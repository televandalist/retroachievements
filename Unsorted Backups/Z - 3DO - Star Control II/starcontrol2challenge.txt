Star Control II is an extreme example, 
even though it doesn't even have levels. 

You can play the entire game without ever 
visiting the Rebel Base at Earth, which 
means no upgrades to your flagship, a very 
short supply of fuel, very few combat ships 
(gained via alliance pacts, which are rare 
in themselves), and a new enemy appearing 
every day (which, in real time, is every 
five seconds). 

Even if you can consistently 
fight off the enemies with zero damage, each 
battle resets your ship's direction, and 
without upgrades, you'll be forced to travel 
everywhere with the slowest possible rotation 
rate and ship speed â€” in a game with a time 
limit. You are screwed. People only started 
doing this more than ten years after the game's 
release, and it was not an intended feature, 
as there's a sequence involving the Rebel Base 
immediately before The Very Definitely Final 
Dungeon and the game would crash doing this; 


the challenge gamers couldn't patch this until 
the game's code became open-source.
