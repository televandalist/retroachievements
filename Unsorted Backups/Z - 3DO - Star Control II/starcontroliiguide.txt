                   I. Starting Off in the Solar System

       D. Next Proceed to Pluto (the outermost planet) and enter orbit,
       scan for energy, land, touch the Spathi, SYMPATHIZE with him. Once
       he is on your side, you are ready for the next step. Write down the
       co-ordinates Fwiffo gives you of his homeworld.


                        II. Dealing with the Spathi 

    Now, you have to get the Spathi as a people to join your cause, heres how:

       A. Once you go to Spathiwa, and talk the ships out of attacking you,
       go to their homeworld and talk to the High Council, ask them everything
       you can, the last thing being to join you. By the way, the Spathi live
       on the moon of their homeworld.

       B. As the council instructed, go to the planet and rid it of all bio
       life forms. Mine it if you wish, then go back to the moon, tell them
       you did what they wanted. Then tell them to join you. They will say
       come back later (GO back immediately), convince them to join, be
       aggressive. (say you still got the "Evil Ones" in suspended animation).


       C. After completing several other steps, the starport commander will
       will say communication was lost with the Spathi, proceed to their
       homeworld's moon, here you will get the Umgah Caster, you will need it
       later, plus you can call the Melnorme trader from anywhere in
       Hyperspace with this.


                   III. Encounter the Zoq-Fot-Pik at Rigel

    Here you gotta meet the Zoq-Fot-Pik and make them your allies.

       A. Proceed to the Star System RIGEL (approximately 210.0 x 210.0).

       B. You will see their ship flying around, if not, go to each planet,
       and they are most likely in orbit. Talk to them, be freindly. They'll
       tell you to go to ALPHA TUCANAE (400.0 x 543.7), their home star system.

       C. Once you are at Alpha Tucanae, enter planet one, yer there! Now
       talk them through, see what they say, be careful though, Ur-Quan's
       hang around in this area. Get them to join you, and to give you their
       ship designs. Then it is safe to go back again, in fact anyone you
       talk to, go back twice. Unless they are hostile.


                    IV. Meeting the Melnorme Trader

    Now you will meet the Melnorme Trader, you will buy important technology
from him to improve your ship, as well as fuel and information.

       A. You will now proceed to go to Alpha Centauri (approx 150.0 x 100.0).
       
       B. You will see the Melnorme ship flying around, approach it, talk with
       him, and to get credits look at our list of Rainbow Worlds at the end
       of the guide, also collect Bio data. You will be able to find the
       trader at any Super Giant star.

       C. In the future, be sure to buy up the Melnorme's technologies, they
       come in handy.


                           V. Orz Territory

     Here, you will talk to the Orz and also get all the items you need from
this area.

       A. Proceed to Delta Vulcupulae (approx. 372.1 x 261.9).

       B. Talk to the ships thuroughly (do not ask about the Androsynth).

       C. Explore the planets until you find what the Orz describe as their
       special place (in the same star system). Convince them to let you land
       and go to the energy spot and pick up the Taalo Shield.

       D. Proceed to Epsilon Vulcupulae, Planet II, this is the former
       homeworld of the Androsynth, land and touch several ruins until
       you pass through them.


                      VI. The Arilou and Quasi-Space

     Here you will meet the Arilou and also start using Quasi-Space for faster
(and cheaper) travel.

       A. Proceed to the top star in the Circini star cluster (43.8 x 637.2).
       Move above the star a little. Stay in Hyperspace and wait until the
       17th of the month, you will see what appears to a Giant Star on your
       display, fall into the portal. By the way, it only lasts 3 days every
       month (17th-20th).

       B. You are now in Quasi-Space. Look at the starmap, plot to the Large
       star off to the right, this is the Arilou homeworld, explore everything
       you can by talking to them thouroughy. Every other star in Quasi Space
       map leads to a certain spot in Hyper-Space, look for the list at the end
       of the guide.

       C. Plot course to the spot in Quasi Space closest to the Arilou home
       world. Enter it, you are back in Arilou space.

       D. Proceed to Alpha Pavonis (approx 55.0 x 800.0). Planet VII.
       Then land and go to the energy spot and from the Ur-Quan wreckage
       get the warp pod from the ship.

       E. Go back to the entrance to Quasi Space on the 17th, once your in go
       to the homeworld and the Arilou will install the Portal Spawner on
       your ship. From now on when you use this you can call a portal to
       Quasi space from anywhere in the galaxy.


                   VII. Getting Rid of Those Annyoning Probes

    When your traveling through space, you encounter those annoying Slylandro
probes, and are forced to fight them, heres how you get rod of them.

       A. Make your way to Beta Corvi (30.0 x 975.0). Go to the Gas Giant (yes,
       to thw GAS GIANT itself), here you will talk to the Slylandro gasbags.
  
       B. After chit-chatting about the past, ask them about the probes, they
       will tell you about them, you have to prod them about the probe's
       program and the replication ability. After you ask them to tell you
       about the program's priority table, it is obvious what to say. Make
       sure you dont leave without them giving you the self-destruct sequence
       dont worry, you wont see it yerself, but you know it.


             VIII. Meeting the Pkunk and Getting the Clear Spindle

     Here you will travel to Pkunk territory and meet them and get the clear
spindle, which you need to complete the Ultron.

       B. Now, once you are in the system, go to the first planet, and land
       on it, explore the cities until you pass through them meaning your
       scientists have nothing more to say.

       C. Now go to the planet's moon, and once in orbit, go to the energy
       source, you've got the Burvix caster, you will need this shortly.


                    X. Meeting and Dealing with the Druuge

        B. Talk to a ship or preferably the first planet, once you explore
        everything they have to say, making sure you have 150 crew (hehe),
        trade them the 100 crew for their ROSY SPHERE, and buy nothing else
        from them, they are now of no further significant use.


                    XI. The Thraddash and the Aqua Helix

       once you defeat that battle group, keep clearing out a few groups, 
       like 15 ships, and then talk to them again, see if they praise you.
       Ask them all throughout about the Aqua Helix, then go to the planet
       and ask them if you can look around the surface, then take the aqua
       helix, and leave.


                       XII. The Suppox and Utwig

       A. Proceed to Beta Librae (get from Nightfire). 

       B. Go to the first planet, talk to the Suppox until they tell you
       about the Ultron and eventually they give it to you.

       C. Then once you are outside their planet, in space, go to your list
       of devices, click on the Clear Spindle, then the Aqua Helix, then the
       Rosy Sphere. This will make the Ultron repaired.
