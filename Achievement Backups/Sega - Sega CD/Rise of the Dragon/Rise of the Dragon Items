Part III: Item Guide
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

   This section will detail the description and uses for every item found in
Rise of the Dragon, as well as where to find each item.  I have done my best to
assure the accuracy of everything in this guide.  In the event that I find
another use for an item, it will be mentioned in a future release of the guide.

Clothes:         You find these laying on the floor of your apartment at the
                 start of the game.  I can't really say if they're fasionable
                 or not because I have never lived in Los Angeles in the year
                 2053, but I assume they are the standard uniform of most
                 Private Investigators in the area.  You must put them on
                 before leaving your apartment or else you will be arrested for
                 indecent exposure.

Coat:            This is found hanging on a coatrack in your apartment at the
                 beginning of the game.  After you put on your clothes, put
                 this on over them before you leave the apartment.  You can
                 always take it off, but Blade will automaticly put it right
                 back on.  Also, when you are wearing the bullet-proof vest you
                 will have to wear the coat on top of it.

Blade's ID Card: Your ID Card is found in the vidphone machine in your apart-
                 ment at the start of the game.  After viewing the messages, be
                 sure to take the card with you as it will allow you to enter
                 your apartment again at a later time.  It can also be used to
                 buy things, and of course to listen to your vidphone messages.


Napent:          The Napent Aerosol Personal Protection Device can be found in
                 the bathroom.  It can be used to put people you encounter into
                 a state of euphoria.  The Sega CD version of the game does not
                 limit it to three uses, and it's quite fun to hear many of the
                 people's reactions when you spray them.  It is especially
                 helpful near the end of the game as a means to gain enterance
                 into the security room.

First-Aid Kit:   This can be found in the bathroom of your apartment.  During
                 the game if you are shot or bitten by a rat, this kit will be
                 able to heal some of the damage.

Chandi's Photo:  The mayor will send you a "vid-transmission hardcopy" (Mayor-
                 speak for "photo") of his daughter's corpse when you listen to
                 his message the first time.  You will need to give this to
                 "The Jake" as proof that you are who you say you are before he
                 agrees to talk to you in his office.

Handgun:         This With & Smesson handgun is hidden behind the pillow in
                 your apartment.  You can use it in the arcade sequences if you
                 have not come across a better weapon yet.

Cabinet Keys:    You get these from Karen the first time you talk to her.  They
                 unlock the cabinet above the sink in your apartment.

Flowers:         You can buy two dozen long stemmed roses from the flower girl
                 in the street at the beginning of the game.  Give them to
                 Karen and play your cards right and you'll witness Blade and
                 Karen on a date.  You can not buy these after making up with
                 Karen.  They cost $200 plus tax.

Wire Tester:     The ACME "Little Giant" Wire Testing Kit can be found in the
                 cabinet above the sink in your apartment.  It is used to tap
                 vidphone lines, but be carefull.  The makers of this wire
                 tester didn't have a warranty regarding electric shock.  Make
                 sure you know what you're doing before you attempt to use this
                 or you will very quickly end up fried to a crisp.

FISTO Bar:       There are two FISTO bars in the game.  These chocolate and
                 bananna peel candybars are very handy when you need to bribe
                 someone because chocolate is such a rare and black market
                 item.  The first can be found in the cabinet above the sink in
                 your apartment, the second is found in Chen Lu's safe.  You
                 should give your first candybar to Slen, the thug outside the
                 Pleasure Dome, in return for the claim check so that you can
                 pick up your gun(s) when you leave.  The second FISTO bar is
                 to be given to The Jake in order to ensure that he will leave
                 you a vidphone message when you are needed.

Bomb:            The Personal Explosive Device is pretty usefull.  You find 
                 four of them in the cabinet above the sink in your apartment.
                 One can be used on the electric panel of the warehouse.  This
                 will give you a little extra time to thwart the Rise of the
                 Dragon.  Your second oppertunity to use one of these bombs is
                 to blow open the locked security panel to gain acces to Johnny
                 Qwong's vidphone lines, which you can tap with your wire
                 tester.  If you get locked out of Chen Lu's apartment and need
                 to get back inside, you can use a bomb to gain enterance but
                 you'll have to hurry because the police will arrive shortly
                 after.

Chen's ID Card:  You will find this ID Card in Chen's vidphone machine when you
                 first pay him a visit.  It can be used to listen to his vid-
                 phone messages as well as to gain enterance into his apartment
                 at a later time.

Claim Check:     You recieve the claim check when you check your gun(s) at the
                 Pleasure Dome (assuming you've bribed Slen with the FISTO Bar
                 already.)  You need this to get back your gun(s) whenever you
                 leave.

MTZ Drug Patch:  You find this patch in Chen Lu's bathroom.  This is the deadly
                 drug responsible for Chandi's death.  If you use the patch it
                 will kill you as it did her, but when you bring it to Karyn
                 at City Hall she will have it analyzed.  When the tape of the
                 analyzation comes back you can speak to the mayor about it.

Parchment:       The parchment from Chen Lu's safe is written in an ancient
                 chinese language.  Chang Li can translate it for you.  This
                 parchment explains about the prophecy of Bahumat and the rise
                 of the dragon.  After Chang Li's translation, he will give you
                 the Rock of Life, a fortune cookie, the Tome of Wisdom, and
                 the bulletproof vest.

Rock of Life:    You recieve the Rock of Life from Chang Li when he translates
                 Chen Lu's parchment for you.  It serves no purpous but can be
                 given to Karyn.

Tome of Wisdom:  Don't worry.
                 Be Happy.

Fortune Cookie:  This cookie's fortune is particularly helpfull.  The code on
                 it can be used to shit down the security in Deng Hwang's
                 home, allowing you access to the final climactiv battle with
                 Bahumat.  The cookie is one of the items you get when you
                 have Chang Li translate the parchment from Chen Lu's safe.

Bulletproof Vest:This vest allows you to take more damage in the arcade
                 sequences.  You get it from Chang Li by having him translate
                 the parchment.

MTZ Videotape:   You recieve this videotape the day after you give Karyn the
                 MTZ patch when you return to speak with her.  After viewing it
                 you can use it to speak with the mayor.

Security Pass:   The LAPD Security Pass will allow you to take the assault
                 rifle from the armoury.  You can only get this pass is you
                 say exactly the right things to the mayor after showing him
                 the MTZ tape.

Snake's ID Card: You get this card after defeating Snake in the first arcade
                 sequence.  It will allow you to enter Deng Hwang's from the
                 front door and bypass security rather than sneaking in from
                 the roof.

Screwdriver:     This can be found in the janitor's closet in Deng Hwang's.
                 It is used to remove the wires from the lower electrical
                 panel in the same room, provided the switch in the top panel
                 has been switched off.

Wires:           These wires are taken from the lower electrical panel in
                 the janitor's closet at Deng Hwangs.  After removing the wires
                 with the screw driver, they can be used un Karyn's body to
                 run a bypass while you remove the wires connected to her neck,
                 rescuing her from death.

Assault Rifle:   You can take this powerful gun from the armoury only if you
                 have the LAPD Security Pass.  It makes the arcade sequences a
                 lot easier.
