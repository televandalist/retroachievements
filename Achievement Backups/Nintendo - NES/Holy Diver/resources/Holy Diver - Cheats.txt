Extra Lives
Start a new game, and in the beginning jump right to the top of the tree. 
Press Start on the first controller to pause the game, hold A + B on the 
second controller, then press Start on the first controller again. The lives 
counter will be increased each time you do this. It is only works on the 
specified height coordinates, there is a lot of places with such coordinates 
other than this, although this is the earliest known rendition of it.
