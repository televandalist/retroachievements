2.0   Basic Tutorial
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Please read this section before the walkthrough. It is basically a
short but helpful guide to give you a headstart in the game. Please
take a few minutes to read this...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1   Basic Concepts
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Progress Mode Support
----------------------------
As you load the game, you will be given the choice of choosing Normal
Display mode or Progressive Mode. Progressive mode requires a TV
compatible with progressive scan (480p) and a component AV cable (for
Playstation 2).

"Hero"
--------------
Like Suikoden and Suikoden II, Suikoden IV has a free name character.
You will be able to name your character at the start of a new game.
Hero is not the default name (as there is no default name) but it is a
commonly accepted name in the Suikoden community. It sounds a lot
better than "main character" and helps me to type less ^_^) I will be
using Hero as the name for the main character.

Main Menu
-----------------------
Upon accessing the menu, you will see the following commands:

      In towns; dungeons            Aboard the ship/Ocean
      ---------------------------   -----------------------------
          Items                         Items
          Rune                          Rune
          Equipment                     Equipment
          Status                        Status
          Formation                     Formation
          Options                       Options
                                        -----------------
                                        Depart/Anchor
                                        Save

Suikoden IV is a classic game and don't expect too many hi-tech
equipment like airships or spaceships and you are bound by the massive
water terrain. You will encounter random battles while sailing in the
ocean. Choose to Anchor to access the inner portion of ship. You can
get items or talk to your allies. When you get your base ship, you
can save anywhere. To return back to the world map, activate menu and
choose Depart.

The World
-----------------------
On the chart screen (or world map which RPG gamers normally call), you
will be able to view red dots on accessible islands. The yellow arrow
is your ship and direction point is the area that you are facing. To
access the next area, just proceed to the yellow area. Hit Circle
button to activate the world map. The ship controls will be discussed
in detail under the walkthrough.

You will encounter random battles while sailing in the world and
you can save anywhere while in the ocean. Unlike most worlds, the area
you navigate is "round". For Suikoden IV, it is a bit special as once
you reach the "border", your ship will be forced to make a U-turn
automatically.

Towns
-----------------------
Hit R2 to activate your radar and you will find a blue radar map on
the lower right corner of the screen. Hit R2 to toggle between corner
map view, full map view or no map view. While on the world map, you
will toggle between compass view.

In the towns, you will find NPCs, townsfolks and chests. Make you
search suspicious objects like bookshelves in shops, wells and even
stoves as you can uncover some items. To examine objects, use the X
button. Hold down R1 button and you will be run in the game. You
will find shops:

Equipment Shop - sells items and accessories
Armour Shop    - sells equipment
Rune Shop      - sells orbs, equip and remove Runes
Trading Post   - allows you to trade items
Inn            - allows you to rest and save your game
Appraiser      - allows you to appraise unknown items e.g. ? Pot
Smithery       - allows you to upgrade weapon
Hot Spring     - allows you to recover lost HP and MP for *free*
Lottery Shop   - allows you to play lottery

In Equipment and Armor Shop, you will find a Bargain Item option.
New items that are not sold in the shops can be found under this
option on a RANDOM basis. Hence, once you find a random equipment
Get it or it may take a lot time for it to reappear. As you purchase
items in shops, you may earn supplementary tickets or lottery tickets
depend on the purchases. These tickets allows you to play the Lottery
game which can nab you the following prizes:

1st Prize (Yellow) - 1st time: Pirate King Crown
                     2nd time: Diamond
                     3rd time: 10000 potch
2nd Place (Red)    - Sunbeam Orb
3rd Place (Green)  - Jizo Clock
4th Place (Blue)   - Mega Medicine
5th Place (White)  - Medicine

"The Base" /Ship
---------------------
Upon getting the base ship, you can change equipment for your ship
party by using the L1 and R1 buttons to toggle between party statuses.
You will also be allow to save anywhere while on the ship or in sea.
To access a new area, just move your ship towards the island (look
out for the harbour as you can't access islands via its other regions)
and you will be given a prompt whether to make a landfall.

Once you have recruit Viki, you can make use of Glowing Hand Mirror
or the mirror to teleport to areas that you have access earlier
instantly. You can use it anything unless you are in part of a story
event.

Status
---------------
As you view the status screen, you will see something like the one
below:

Page 1                Page 2                ATK:     Attack
-------------------   ------------------    DEF:     Defense
Hero                  Hero
HP:  11 / 11          Training Sword        STR:     Strength
MP:  1.0.0.0          WPN LVL   1           SKL:     Skill
                      WPN PWR   12          MAG:     Magic
LV:  1  ATK   15                            EVA:     Evasion
Exp  0  DEF    3      Elemental             PDF:     Physical Defense
                      Fi.       0           MDF:     Magic Defense
STR   3   PDF   3     Wa.       0           SPD:     Speed
SKL   3   MDF   2     Wi.       0           LUC:     Luck
MAG   3   SPD   3     Ea.       0           WPN LVL: Weapon Level
EVA   3   LUC   2     Li.       0           WPN PWR: Weapon Power

I love to keep things simple hence pardon me for the simple data
diagrams above. Throughout the walkthrough, I will illustrates a lot
these types of diagrams to allow you to understand how to use a
certain character. All characters vary differently. They can be strong
attackers but slow speed. They can be good magic attackers but low HP.
It is a balance of power between attack and speed, magic and attack
and HP with magic. Hence it is a good way to balance them out. Besides
the table below will explain what does the status does:

   -----------------------------------------------------------------
   ATK        Attacking power
   DEF        Defense power
   I believe these two stats will have some impact on the
   character's overall performance in naval battles when you
   choose them as your fighters.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
   STR        Affects character's physical attacks
   SKL        Affects character's attack with Skill Runes
   MAG        Affects cahracter's attack with Magic Runes
   EVA        Affects character's evasion rate
   PDF        Affects character's defense against physical attacks
   MAG        Affects character's defense against magic
   SPD        Affects character's timing of turns
   LUC        Affects rates of critical, dodge and counter
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
   WPN LVL    Character's current weapon level
   WPN PWR    Character's weapon attacking power

   The higher the weapon level, the more damage the weapon will
   deal. You can upgrade this stats by visiting the smithery
   ------------------------------------------------------------------

Each character can equipped a maximum of 3 Runes, a head gear, a body
gear, an arm gear, a foot gear and 3 accessories. The Runes
equipability depends on the character's MAG stats. More details will
be cover in the later sections.

Saving
--------------
You can save your game by using Save Points (a blue orb on a pedestal)
or the Inn. You can save anywhere on the World. Once you got the base
ship, you can save anywhere while aboard the ship. A save file requires
93kb of memory card space. If you see a (S) icon at the walkthrough, it
means it is highly recommend to save your game at that juncture.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2   Party Setup & Formations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The party comprises of 4 members and a support character. The four
members are arranged in the following formation:

            1            4
                2    3

The support character will not be involved in the battle but gives you
other bonuses such as healing and gaining additional items. Normally,
I would recommend #1 and #4 character as an attacker with decent HP
while those with lower HP at #2 and #3 slot of the formation. The
closer your character is up front, the more damage they will take.
Hence keep magic users at #2 or #3.

Suikoden IV is a turn-based battle. In other words, enemies or
characters will take their turns depending on the character's SPD
stats. The higher the speed stats (SPD), the more turns the character
will have.

When you enter in the battle, you will see the following commands:

     Before getting the ship       After getting the ship
    --------------------------    ------------------------
           Fight                           Fight
           Flashes*                        Flashes*
           Retreat/Release                 Retreat/Release
           Potch                           Potch
           Rush                            Rush
           Auto                            Change Party
                                           Auto

* Flashes will ONLY be available if someone is equipped with the Slash
  Orb and the party's level is much higher (i.e. 2 of the characters
  can kill the enemy in one hit). It is an instant kill attack. It will
  replace Release command.

Fight will allow you to choose your character's individual attacks and
you will see the character's command list, which will be explained
later. 

Retreat will allow you to escape from battles. There are certain
battles that you can't win hence retreat is the only way out. Please
note that you can't escape from story-based battles or boss fights.
BTW, retreat does not work all the time. There can be sometime you will
fail.

Potch works like bribing. Potch is the currency in Suikoden IV and you
can pay potch to end the battle but it is not going to worth the while
as Potch is extremely important in Suikoden.

Rush is an area attack that is a "free" turn. You can use Rush only
when the yellow gauge below the characters status screen on the battle
is maxed out and Hero is required to be in the party. To build up the
gauge, you need to attack and win battles.

Change Party will be available until you get the "ship". You can have
a total of 3 parties. A main party with Hero as the compulsory
character and 2 Ship Party, which can be used only for random battles
on the ship. This option is useful as it prevents you to having an
unbalance party of characters. (i.e. some characters too strong while
some too weak) But normally when training characters, I will have 2
strong characters while weak characters occupying the #2 and #3 slot
or #4 slot if he/she has decent HP.

Auto will cause the computer to control your characters to use the
Attack command to attack for the remaining turns.

You will see the following commands after you have selected:

Attack
Defend
Rune
Item
Combo

Attack
----------
I will explain the Rune and Combos under in the later sections. Attack
is the most basic way of attacking enemy. Different characters will
perfrom different amount of hits and it depends solemnly on the
character's strength, attack stats and weapon stats. The higher these
stats are, the more damage they will deal. Weapon stats have an
importance in the amount of damage that you deal with Attack. You can
upgrade weapons at the smithery. Please refer to the equipment tutorial
section for details.

Defend
-----------
Defend works the opposite of Attack. When defending, your character
has a higher chance of countering and receives lower damage when
enemy's attack hit your character. There are various types of defenses.

Items
------------
Under your items listing, there is an Usable Items list right? These
items can be used from the Item command list. Below are the some of
game's important items:

Medicine:         Restores health
Mega Medicine:    Restores health
Jizo Clock:       Revives fallen character
Antitoxin:        Cures poison
Cough Drops:      Cures silence
Needle:           Cures balloon
Mushroom:         Recovers MP

Jizo Clock becomes indispensible in part of the stages. Hence it is
advisible to save them for tough dungeons. Escape Talisman is useful
before you gotten the magic mirror. But once you gotten it, it is not
necessary to stock them up. Please refer to items bestiary for more
details.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3   Runes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Runes are also know as the magic source for Suikoden IV. In Suikoden,
there are 4 level of attack spells and Magic is listed in the following
format

      LV1  LV2  LV3  LV4
      0    0    0    0

Let's say if you have 5.3.1.0, you can use level 1 spells 5 times,
level 2 spells 3 times, level 3 spell 1 time and level 4 spell none.
To restore MPs, use mushroom to restore or stay in a inn or rest in
your bed. Compared to previous series, magic has become more useful in
Suikoden IV.

There are 2 types of Runes - Skill and Magic. Magic Runes conserves
MP and examples are like Fire, Water, Earth and Wind. Skill Runes
does not conserve MP but they provide additional effects like for an
example - Killer Orb, it provides the increase possibility of critical
hits (don't use it via Rune command) or Shrike Rune (Mizuki's Rune)
which is usable via Rune command only.

To equip/remove a Rune, you need obtain Orbs and visit Runemasters at
Rune Shops and pay a fee to equip them. There are certain Runes (e.g.
Kika's Falcon Rune, Ornan's Waking Rune) that cannot be unequipped.
Runes can be obtained via purchasing from Rune shops, bargain finds in
equipment shop, search from areas, or playing the treasure hunting
mini-game.

The ability of a character to use a level spell depends on the
character's level and magic level. The higher the magic stats and a
higher level a character is, you can equip more Rune or use higher
level spells. A character can have a maximum of 3 Runes (head, left
hand and right hand)

For details about Runes, please refer to the Runes Bestiary.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.4   Experience Points and Levelling Up
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
To gain a level, you need a 1000 experience points. Enemies will award
different amount of EXP for different and its HP will varies from
battle to battle.

Hence, I would like to clear up that the HP of enemies are based on
rough estimates and my sheer guessing (I have used a calculator to count
the hits the enemy receives...) It is better to have it than having
nothing as HP normally depends on the impact of the enemy's strengths
and weakeness...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.5   Naval Battles
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Throughout the course of the game, you will need to fight in naval
battles. In Suikoden IV, ships is able to use the power of Runes to
fight as shells.

Captaincy
---------------
Throughout the course of the game, you can have a total of 5 captains:
Hero, Snowe, Lino En Kludes, Kika and Elenor. Captains will determine
the ship's mobility and mobility will affect your ship's speed and
turns.

Rune Cannon
----------------
The elemental chart below is a summary of the elemental weakness and
strengths. For example, Fire will nullify against Fire, it is weak
against Water but strong against Wind. It is neutral against Lightning
and Earth.

 \ Enemy    Fire        Water       Wind       Lightning      Earth
Element   ____________________________________________________________
Fire        Nullify     Weak        Strong     Neutral        Neutral
Water       Strong      Nullify     Neutral    Weak           Neutral
Wind        Weak        Neutral     Nullify    Neutral        Strong
Lightning   Neutral     Strong      Neutral    Nullify        Weak
Earth       Neutral     Neutral     Weak       Strong         Nullify

Please refer to the Rune Affirnity Chart for who is suitable to use
which Runes as their Rune Cannon.

Fighters
-----------------
You have a choice of 4 fighters. I would prefer 4 fighters who has
high HP, ATK and DEF for these position. The ATK and DEF stats are the
ones that are shown next to the character's level and experience points
gained on the status screen. They will have also an impact on the
underlings. During a boarding battle, you CANNOT use Runes, Items,
Potch or Retreat. You have only left with combos and attack. There is
ONE important point to take note off. Once a character died in the
ship boarding battle, he will no longer be able to use in future
battles. If you see the roster, his/her name will be in red and you
can't use the character ANYMORE. So it is reasonable to upgrade the
weapons and give them the best armor before selecting them for the
fight.

Underlings
-----------------
Underlings are known as the HP of the ship. The higher the underlings,
the more HP your ship has. (i.e. more damage it can substain from
enemies' Rune Cannons) But it will reduce the ship's speed and
mobility.

Boarding
-----------------
Boarding is extremely useful when figthers are good attackers i.e.
they have high attack and defend stats. But there is a point to take
note of. If a ship of yours being boarded by the opposition and all
your characters dies in that battle, non-story characters will marked
as death towards the ending of the game. You will be unable to use him
for the remaining of the game. To board a ship, you must be at least 1
square away from the enemy.

For more details about naval battle, please refer to Section 9.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.6   Duel
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a classic one-on-one battle. You can only choose 3 commands -
Attack, Guard or Special. At the start of the duel, you can choose to
battle with normal or full power.

To win a Duel, you need to knock your opponent's HP down to zero and
victory will be yours. The list of possible outcomes are listed in the
table below:
 ____________________________________________________________________
| Your's  |  Opponent's | Effect                                     |
|---------|-------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Special |  Special    | Both receives same amount of damage        |
| Special |  Attack     | You deal heavy damage to your opponent     |
| Special |  Guard      | You deal no damage and opponent counter... |
| Guard   |  Special    | You counter your opponent's special        |
| Guard   |  Attack     | You receive some damage.                   |
| Guard   |  Guard      | Nothing happened...                        |
| Attack  |  Special    | You receive heavy damage                   |
| Attack  |  Attack     | Nothing happened...                        |
| Attack  |  Guard      | Your opponent receive some damage.         |
|_________|_____________|____________________________________________|

The key words to win a duel is patience and paying attention to your
opponent's speeches. If the enemy attacks you with Special, use Guard
to counter it. If the enemy uses Guard, attack him/her with an Attack.
If the enemy uses Attack, counter it with Special. Besides, the
walkthrough has even listed their quotes and the correct response that
you should use...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.7   Combos
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Certain characters can combo for a combo attack that deals weaker
damage but affect more enemies or deals more damage against an enemy.
Combos can be executed by 2 characters, 3 characters and even 4
characters!

Using a Combo
---------------
In order to use a combo, the characters involve the combo must not use
his/her turn for any other command. The characters must not be affected
by a status ailment that cause him/her unable to execute it (i.e. Sleep
etc). For the full list of combos, please check out the Combos Bestiary.

Learning Combos
----------------
All Combos except for Hero and Snowe's Friendship Attack requires you
to gain battle victories in order to learn them. I.e. you need to fight
battles with the characters involved and you will learn them
eventually. For example for Kika and Hero to learn the Double Sword
Attack, you need to have them battle for 10 battles before they will
learn it.

Levelling Up Combos
--------------------
Combos can be more effective when you win more battles with the setup
characters that are involved in the combo. I.e. To level up the Ninja
Attack, Akaghi and Mizuki must be in the party. A Combo attack can
levelled up to level 3 and they will deal damage if the weapons are
being upgraded to a higher level. Some combos carry an element.

For more details about Combos, please read the Combos Bestiary.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.8   Recruitment
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
There are a total of 108 stars or characters that you can recruit. You
can start recruiting people once you establish your base upon meeting
Lino En Kludes, King of Obel.

To recruit people, you need to trigger events. For some characters, you
need existing characters in your party before you can recruit them
while for others, you need to complete a quest before you can have them
joining you. For details on character's recruitment, please refer to
section 10 for more details.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.9   Maintaining Equipment
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
There are basically 3 basic equipment - weapons, armor and accessory.

Weapons
-----------------
Each character has a specific type of weapon and you cannot unequip
them. To upgrade a weapon, you must visit the smithery to upgrade them
by sharpening them. The fees are fixed and different character's
weapons will be different in upgrading. Upgrading is limited by levels.
To gain levels in upgrading weapon, you need to get a key item - a 
Hammer. Give it to your smithy (Adrienne) who will join you throughout
the course of the game and he will be able to level up your weapons.
The highest level that you can attained is level 16. The weapon affects
attacking power whether it is for duel, naval battles or battles. So
make you sharpen them often.

Fees for sharpening                      Hammers            Max Level
-----------------------------------      ----------------------------
LV 02    300p       LV 10    18000p      Iron Hammer           9
LV 03    600p       LV 11    27000p      Copper Hammer         12
LV 04    1500p      LV 12    35000p      Silver Hammer         15
LV 05    2700p      LV 13    43000p      Gold Hammer           16
LV 06    3500p      LV 14    52000p
LV 07    4500p      LV 15    60000p
LV 08    7000p      LV 16    70000p
LV 09    11000p

Through the battles, enemies ocassionally drop Rune Pieces where you
can have them affix to your character's weapon. For example if you
equip a Lightning Rune Piece on the character's weapon, he/she will
deal more damage against enemies who are weak against Lightning (i.e.
marine creatures). It is an additional benefit. Hence get them on your
weapons.

Armor
-----------------
Armor can be equipped on four body portions - head, body, arm and foot.
They can be bought from armor shop found in town. As you progress into
the game, you will be able to purchase better equipment. Like wise, you
can also make use of items that you obtained from battles such as
scales, feathers, ores (obtained from trading post) and combine them
into armor by talking to Adrienne (at the smithery) or Phil (at the
shipwright). Different character classes can equip a certain class of
armor. For details, please refer to Armor Bestiary.

Accessory
-----------------
Accessory can be bought from equipment shop (or item shop as what other
RPG used to call) and each character can equip a maximum 3 accessories.
Accessories can be obtained via questing and treausre hunting too. You
can have more accessories via combining raw materials by visiting the
Mermaid Shop (Accessory Atelier)

2.10   Tips/ Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Blinking Mirror not 100% effective!
------------------------------------
When you recruited Viki, you can teleport to places that you have
visited by talking to her which is really convenient. However, certain
cutscenes can only be trigger when you enter the port (i.e. you need to
view the world map and re-enter again by having your ship making
contact with the port).

Save your game
-----------------
There are numerous save points through the battle. It is highly
recommended to save often, besides being an RPG is not quite possible
to complete this game within a day. When you see the following:

(S) Save your game

This means you are reaching a cruical point and if you do not save your
game, you will miss something that will have an impact on your game
such as a valuable accessory etc. Hence keep a lookout for them.

Training Tips
----------------
Training can be boring and redundant in RPG. But this is the "rice
bowl" of playing RPG. You are bound to encounter enemies and enemies
will get tougher as you progress into the game. If you don't train
your party well, you will definitely experience difficulties.
Throughout the walkthrough, I have provide some battle tips against
the enemy within the area along with some really useful training tips.

Earning Potch
----------------
Potch can be earned in various methods. You can win potch via trading
at trading post (buy low, sell high and you will earn on the
difference). Likewise, you can equip a Prosperity Rune (Lo Seng) and
you will win double the amount. Don't be worry about the shortage of
money in early part of game as it is common thing in playing Suikoden.
Normally, I would recommend you to start bulk purchasing at the late
of the game. At the initial part of the game, always upgrade weapons 
and armor for your main party and have their existing armor on other
characters. Likewise, you can make use of combining materials and sell
the armor made from these materials (yup Adrienne, Phil and the
mermaids will charge you nothing for making them).

3.0   Walkthrough
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
This is a long walkthrough and I will try to keep the story events to
the minimum. The objective of this walkthrough is to complete the game
and gathering all 108 Stars of Destiny. Use this walkthrough only. If
you want to complete the game quickly for the sake of completing for
the ending, please refer to other walkthroughs.

By the way, there are a lot of SPOILERS in this walkthrough but I have
tried my best to keep them to the minimum.

                         ================
                            IMPORTANT
                         ================

Enemies' stats
--------------------
The enemies' stats are based on my estimation as in the game there is
no Scan or Sense spell that allows you to view enemy's HP. But I listed
them down is to provide you a gauge on how you would handle the battle.

(S) Save your game
--------------------
This is a new addition for my walkthroughs. When you see this symbol
along with the word, I HIGHLY recommend you to save your game as a
mistake will leak you to miss an accessory/equipment or even a Star
of Destiny (SOD).

Enter via ship
----------------
Do not overuse the Blinking Hand Mirror to enter and exit towns in
recruiting people. Some of the events can be triggered ONLY when you
exit the town via ship i.e. you need to exit out of the town phyiscally.

Bargain Items
---------------
When you visit Equipment or Armor Shops, you will find a special
option called "Bargain Items". Rare items will appear randomly for sale
and therefore remember to check them out for new items. Some of the
items will provide additional support and advanced support.

RPG Golden Rules
-----------------
Having being completed more than 10 RPGs, I could summarise playing RPG
in a few rules:

- Pay attention to the speeches. Some of the speeches will drop a hint
  and that could lead to something special.

- Save often and be daring. Do not be afraid to test out new things and
  the experience could help you in future battles. Be explorative in
  dungeons. Once your HP or MP got too low, exit the dungeons and
  return back your room and heal (once you got Viki in the party)

- Some bosses are a bit too difficult at the moment. Hence if you looks
  too powerful do not hestiate to retreat. There are some very powerful
  and tough random battles if your party are untrained. Kill off the
  stronger enemies in the ground so that you will be having dealt less
  damage.

- Better equipment and having more random battles will make your life
  easier. In other words, higher level and equipment will allow you to
  have an easier game than sending an unprepared party. When training
  low level characetrs, bring 2 strong characters and unleash your
  strongest spell so that weak character could gain levels instantly.
  Ted is a good choice. To optimise the effect, have 3 Speed Rings
  on Ted for training in the earlier part of game. Once you have gotten
  sufficient cash, upgrade Kika and Hero's weapon to the maximum and
  you will find how useful the Double Sword Attack can be. Likewise,
  don't look down unlovely characters such as Gau, Shiramine and
  Ugetsu, they can pack a punch they are being used properly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.01  Prologue
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:    Medicine x10, Bandana x1, Tunic x1, Leather Helm x1, Chain
          Mail x1, Scale Shield x1, Leather Boots x1
Potch:    200p - begins with it.

You will begin the game with naming your character. I choose "Hero" and
I will be refering it throughout the walkthrough.

Afterwards, you will be allow to adjust the options. Once you are done,
hit the start button to carry on. After some cutscenes, you will engage
in your first battle - a naval battle!

Snowe will provide you with some help.

                   Naval Battle #1 - First Engagement
 ____________________________________________________________________
 You will be given a tutorial from Jewel. Choose the top option and
 Snowe will drop some hints. The objective is to destroy the
 opponent's ship.

 Opponent: ?????
                       Victory conditions: 
        Counter the enemy's attack and emerge victorious.

  Crew Members:
  Hero     HP 10 ATK 14 DEF 5 Underlings 12
  Tal      HP 11 ATK 14 DEF 8 Underlings 8
  Paula    HP 10 ATK 12 DEF 5 Underlings 10
  Keneth   HP 10 ATK 13 DEF 5 Underlings 10
  Jewel    HP 10 ATK 13 DEF 5 Underlings 8

  - Listen to the hints: "...can fire lightning & water Rune Shells"
  - Therefore, choose someone with a lightning Rune - Pick Keneth!
  - Place the remaining four members as your fighters
  - Take the maximum number of underlings. You can take a maximum of
    49 underlings if you choose the above setup. You will have more
    "hit points" if you choose less underlings. The opponent has 60
    hit points by the way.
  - Move to the 3rd square and press Left/Right to attack the opponent
    with your Rune Cannon. Counter when the opponent's attack you.
 _____________________________________________________________________

This is shortly follow by your first battle. It will be against a man
and a woman. Just follow the instructions from Snowe and you will be
fine. Seize the opportunity to get use to commands and controls. The
battle will ends once either the man (Glen) or woman (Katarina) is
knocked out. Snowe is equiped with the Water Rune, where Kindness Drops
restores HP. The battle will end if Hero dies. However, if you want to
win the battle, I recommend you to follow Snowe's instructions. You
are bound to use a Medicine in the battle anyway.

There will be some more cutscenes. Glen (the man) will challenge you
to a one-on-one battle. Choose the bottom option. You can view your
status screen. Snowe will be part of your party. There is a save point
in the room which allows you to save your game.

  My next move will settle this once and for all! -> Guard
  I will strike you with all your might           -> Guard
  -----------------------------------------------------------------

Well after the sparring match, you will be free to roam. You can find
your teammates at the following locations:

  Lower deck: Katarina
  Upper deck: Jewel, Tal and Keneth

Talk to everyone and this will be followed by some more scenes. Talk
to Tal and there will be more cutscenes and well you are starting
the game...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.02   Hall of Knights
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:    Old Book Volume 9, Steamed Bun x1, Water Orb x1

Head for the yellow marker on the map. You will reach the courtyard
area. There is a door that leads to the hallway leading to Audience
Chamber. You can find a chest containing an Old Book Volume 9. Exit
and move to the next door on the right, you will find Hero's room in
this hallway. There is a chest containing a Water Orb and Steamed Bun.
There is also a save point where you can save your game. If you move
up the Spire, you will be able to reach Commander Glen's room.

There is nothing much to do other than heading for the Training Hall
where you will find Kataronia at the doorway. There will be some
more scenes and some history... (do you hate history classes? ^_^)

Exit the courtyard. Head for the port which is located at the first
area.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.03   Razril (Port)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:   Mushroom x1, Medicine x1, Stomach Band x1, Sandals x1,
         Tunic x2, Mittens x1, Robe x1, Gloves x1

(S) Save your game

There is a save point here. Since it is night time, there are nothing
much to visit as all shops are close. Ignore the entranceway (yellow
marker) that is on right next to the equipment if you go there, you
will have random battles.

Just move all your way towards north and you will trigger a cutscene
automatically. Eventually, you receives a torch of fire where Hero
could use it as his weapon ^_^ if you visit the Back Street area.

After the cutscene of Hero receiving the torch, you will be back at
the main street leading to the square. There are people in the main
street holding torches. Talk to them to light their torches. There are
a total of 8 torches to light...

Make your way to the Square and it will be followed some cutscenes and
fireworks. Talk to everyone (Paula, Katarina, Glen, Tal, Jewel, Keneth
and Lord Vingerhut). Exit the area via the main walkway not the one
that is leading towards the back street. Just head south off the main
street. Talk to everyone and there will be one man claiming that her
daughter is missing.

There is a cat at the area. Examine it and choose "Pet It" and you
will receive a Medicine! Move forward and you will find a cat-man
loitering around. Talk to it (Chiepoo) and you will get a notfication
from it that a girl has been kidnapped. It is optional on whether you
want to gather your party (you can have a maximum of four members).
I would do so as it will make the party more "balanced".

* Do not take off their equipment or you will have troubles in the
  upcoming training hall session.

I recommend Keneth as his Lightning Rune is extremely useful when
fighting a group of enemies along with another character of your
choice. Remember the walkway? Just use it this time round...

- Back Street -
 ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 Enemies: Shobby Shrew, Thug
 ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

There is nothing much except you will find a empty backyard. Just move
on the pathway and you will encounter random battles there. There is
a chest located along the pathway where you can get a Mushroom.

Proceed to the open area where you find a lot of broken pillars. Look
for a man facing a crate. It is pretty well hidden there. Talk to him
and you will fight...

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Kidnapper                   HP: 100     Potch:
   Kidnapper Underling         HP: 50      160p

   Just make use of Keneth's Lightning Rune if you have him in
   party for a quick finish. Or you may want to use the
   Friendship Attack between Snowe and Hero...
   
   Items: ? Pot (Pot of Razril)
          ? Painting (Grafitti)
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Search the crate for a Treasure Map item. This is your ONLY chance to
get it! Head for the town entrance and choose to rest your day. You
part ways with your teammates.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.04   Hall of Knights
----------------------------------------------------------------------

(S) Save your game

You will be back at your room again. You can restore your HP and MP by
resting here. Save your game if you haven't do so. Exit the room. You
will meet Funghi in at the kitchen that is next to your room. Make
your way to courtyard. Exit the courtyard to the port and Snowe will
rejoin your party. You will be back at the courtyard. Make your way to
the training hall.

If you talk to the trainee before talking to your friends, you will be
fighting 3x Trainee where you can gain some experience points along
with 30p. This can be done infinite amount of times until you have
talked to your crew.

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Trainee A                   HP:  10            Potch: 30p
   Trainee B                   HP:  10
   Trainee C                   HP:  10

   - This is really simple. Just attack...
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Talk to one of your crew members (Tal, Keneth, Paula or Jewel) and you
will be able to form a party of four with Hero and Snowe as compulsory
members.

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Senior Knight               HP:  50            Potch: Nil
   - This is really simple. Just attack...
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Dowe will suggest changing the party member. Your selected members
will be replaced by ones that are not selected. I will not recommend
Tal before of his weak starting defense. To train Tal, bring in Keneth
and have him using Berserk Blow. Once Tal is level 2, he should be
able to survive on his own.

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Senior Knight A             HP:  50           Potch: Nil
   Senior Knight B             HP:  50

   If you have Keneth, use him to cast Berserk Blow and all
   enemies will be killed.
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

You will be given 2 options. The 2nd option will ends the whole
practice session.

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Senior Knight A             HP:  50           Potch: Nil
   Senior Knight B             HP:  50           EXP:   200

   If you have Paula, use her to cast Wind of Sleep and attack
   enemies while they sleeping...
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

I supposed my hints are quite direct (^_^). Once you are done, pick
the bottom option "I've decided." You will be allowed to battle once
again with your desired formation. Exit the Hall of Knights and make
your way to Razril.

   Fire Orb             500p      Bargain items are pretty random
   Water Orb            500p      hence it is quite pointless to
   Align/Remove Rune    240p      list them down.
   ****************************************************************

Port Area
-------------
On the pathway, you will see 3 groups of ladies. Talk to one of them
and you will be prompted to comment on the food. Choose "It was very
delicious!" Do some shopping. The currency used in the game is potch.
For both equipment shop and armor shop, you will find a Bargain item
column where you can get some rare equipment and items (items also
include sealed orbs)
You will meet Chiepoo at the Equipment Shop. Remember the orbs that
you have gotten earlier. You can equip them by visiting Rune Shops.
Equiping and remove Runes requires you to pay 240p per enlightment.
I would recommend you to align the Water Rune you found earlier for
Hero. Search the chair next to bookshelf and you will get a Medicine!

 Random Battles - Back Street
 ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 If you are running out of money or potch, you can get some by
 fighting random battles at the back street area. There is a new
 enemy there. I recommend you to have all players at least level 4.
 
 Enemies: Hairball, Thug
 ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Town Square
----------------
You will meet Basil at the town square where you will get to play a
mini-game - Top Tossing. Please refer to Mini Games Section for more
details. It will cost you 100 potch per game. I won't recommend playing
it as you are pretty tied up on money.

Talk to the lady at right side of the square and you will get a
Mushroom! You will meet Konrad in the Inn. Search the bookshelf at the
northeast corner and you will get a Treasure Map! The hotel fee is
800p (!) There is nothing much to do other heading back to the port at
the Hall of Knights.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.06  Hall of Knights
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:    Medicine x5

Well, that's all for your exploration for Dazil. Time to start work...
Proceed to the port area outside the Hall of Knights courtyard. Proceed
to the ship and it will trigger a cutscene. You will get 2 prompts.
Pick "Yes, let's go." and here are the jobs:

- Defeat wild sea creatures 3 times
- Deliver a document to Middleport

Choose the first one. Your objective is encounter 3 random battles.
The ship controls are rather hard to move as you need to twirl it
with the left analog stick to change its direction. Just loither
around area for 3 random battles.

 Random Battles - Sea near Razril
 ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 Enemies: Seaweed, Muddy Fish

 The enemies are pretty weak as you can handle them out easily
 with normal attacks. Just win 3 battles.
 ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

If you activate the main menu, you will find 2 options - Anchor and
Save. Anchor will allows you to enter the ship on board. Inside the
room found in Gaien Training Ship, there is a save point and a chest
containing 5x Medicine! To return back to the World Map, activate
menu and select "Depart".

Upon finishing the 3 battles, Snowe will prompt you where you want to
return back to the port. Choose to return and you will be back at the
port near Knights of Hall automatically. If you did not, you can
return back having your ship making contact with the island.

Return back to your room and heal your wounds (sleeping the inn or
resting in your own room recovers HP and MP). Return back here for
your second mission. Choose to go for the mission.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.06   Departing for Middleport
----------------------------------------------------------------------
You will be back at the world map and here are the controls

Up       Move ship forward      []             Activate Menu
Left     Turn ship left         O              View Chart Screen

L1       Change Camera View     R1             Accelerate
R2       Change Compass View

The ship is a bit hard to control but it takes time for you to adapt
to it. Activate the menu and you will get to save your game or anchor
when you will get to access the ship. Hit the O button.

You will see the following list of commands:
X          Change Course
Triangle   Exit Chart Screen
O          Switch Display
[]         Island Shift

 ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 Enemies:  Wild Seaweed, Muddy Fish
 ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

As you see from the chart screen or world map, you will find that
Middleport is actually southeast off Razril. Just activate the chart
screen and point the your cursor at Middleport. Once you reach the
sea near Middleport, you will need to manually adjust your ship and
located the port (which is orange in colour). Just choose to dock it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.07   Middleport
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:  Treasure Map x1, Mushroom x1, Antitoxin x1, Fancy Console x1
Potch:  2500p

Harbor

You will find a man and a knight at entrance way. Talk to them and you
will need kill a monster in the seas near Middleport. The battle is
quite tough and hence it would be advisible to visit the town first.

Below is the shopping list:

   ***************************************************************

It is rather hard to make shopping list for Suikoden IV as there are
a lot of items that randomly appears. This also applies to the trading
post. The prices of the tradable items varies from time to time. Make
use of buy low and sell high. You may need to reset your PS2 often to
get desired prices.

There is a trading post and appraiser shop in this area. You can
have the appraiser to appraise your ? Pots or Paintings that you
have obtained from battles while in Razril for 200p per appraisal.
Once these items have been uncovered, you sell them for large
amount of money! If you appraise the 2 items - one of them is the Pot
of Razril while other one is Graffiti.

There is nothing much to do other than heading for the Town Square.

Middleport (Centre Square)
-----------------------------
Well, you have saved up a lot of potch up to now. In the left
hand side of the square, you will meet Gunter where you can play
a dice mini-game (please refer to mini-games for more details). You
can play Down-to-One (min. 80p) or Triple Toss (min. 100p)

Head for the pathway behind him and it will leads the backstreet.
The street is a straightforward one and it leads to an empty house.
Search the barrel located on the right of the door and you will get
a Antitoxin. Search the chest nearby and you find another Mushroom.

Retrace your steps and move back to the Square. You can find the
equipment shop, armor shop and smithery on the top left hand corner
of the screen. Pay a visit to the Smithery and you will meet Adrienne
there. I recommend you to upgrading the character's weapon as it will
raise their attack. Upgrade Hero's weapon to level 3. As for attaching
Rune pieces, ignore it for the time being.

You will meet Pecola outside the inn who is being surrounded by a
group of woman. Visit the inn and search the paintings in the inn for
another Treasure Map item. It is in the southeast corner. There is a
spinning game but it requires you to have a Lottery Ticket. You can
save your game by talking to female innkeeper and sleep there for 120p.
Stay in the inn and make sure you some MP for magic casters. You can
earn a Supplementary Ticket by purchasing 500p in Middleport. Once
you got 5 of these, you will earn a lottery ticket. Visit the lottery
corner. 

Just rotate the right analog stick and your prize depends on the ball
that drops from the box.

1st place (yellow):  1st time - Pirate King Crown
                     2nd time - Diamond
                     3rd time - 10000 potch
2nd place (red)   :  Sunbeam Orb
3rd place (green) :  Jizo Clock
4th place (blue)  :  Mega Medicine
5th place (white) :  Medicine

Take the central path and head north...

Middleport (Lord's Mansion)
----------------------------
You will find a chest on the right of the gates. It contain a Fancy
Console. There is nothing much to do in the mansion. Return back to the
harbour. Talk to Knight. Hit the ocean.

Loither your ship around Middleport for random battles. Wait until you
have encounter a Damp Hairball (a black flurry object). Once you got
that, prepare for a tough fight.

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Damp Hairball               HP:  ~350          Potch: 500
   It is really hard as your attacks weaken even if Hero's
   weapon has been upgraded to level 3. Damp Hairball's attack
   are generally normal except it could cast a water spell that
   does around 20+ HP damage to all characters. Make use of
   Kindness Drops or Medicine once a character is low on HP.

   Items: ? Pot (Pot of Razril)
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Upon defeating it, return back to Middleport and you will get another
2000p by talking to the fisherman. Now there is much to do in the
town or you might want to play some dice. Go back to Razril.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.08   Hall of Knights
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:   Nothing!

You will meet Katarina and there will be an uncoming mission where
both Hero and Snowe has a separate mission. Approach the gates of
the courtyard and your other 2 members will leave the current party.

There will be some cutscenes and you will introduced to Ramada at
the Audience Chamber. There will be another cutscene between Snowe
and Hero. Next you are free to roam. Make your way to the port and
Snowe will part ways with you. Now make your way to Razril. The shops
are selling the same stuff but you will find new items under the
Bargain items hence check it out...

Make your way towards the port area that is outside the enterance
that leads to the main street. You will meet Akaghi and Mizuki and
a cutscene. Once the cutscene is over, return back to the Hall of
Knights. At the entrance of the courtyard, you will find Snowe. Talk
to him. Make your way to Audience Chamber and talk to Ramada. Pick
the first option.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.09   Trip to IIluya
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:    Nothing!

If you choose to anchor, visit the upper deck. There is a knight who
is training...

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Gaien Soldier               HP: 50             Potch: 100

   since you last fought a Gaien soldier..

   Items: N/A

You will be given 2 options. Pick the top option. Let's fight! You
have another naval battle...

Remember this phrase:
 "The captain is always the last to leave..."

                   Naval Battle #2 - Pirate Brandeau
 ____________________________________________________________________

 Victory conditions:
 Emerge victorious against the 2 enemy pirate ships.

 They are having fire and lightning elements and you are the captain
 too. You will need to pick your elements. Choose them wisely.

 Have an underlings of 95.

 Strategy:
 The enemy will be able to move twice. Once you are done. Move towards
 in range against Pirate Ship A (with a flag). Use Knight of Gaien 2's
 Rune Cannon against it. Lightning is weak against Earth. Once the
 Pirate Ship A attacks you again, counter with Knight of Gaien 2's
 Rune Cannon. The battle is over in a blink of an eye...

 Next handle Pirate Ship B using Knight of Gaien 3's Rune Cannon.
 Congrats as you are victorous!

After some cutscenes and you will fight...

   Snowe will not be part of your party and you will have a
   Knight of Gaien as your partner instead, who comes with a

   around 11+ HP damage to both Hero and your partner. A wind
   slash attack that does 20+ on one ally. Pirate Brandeau has
   the ability to heal himself using Kindness Drops, therefore

----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.11   Razril
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:   Cough Drop, Mega Medicine x2, Commander's Medicine

Make your way to the item shop. There will be some cutscenes. Make
your way the main street. Look for man who is dressing in a green
shirt with a red belt. You will get a Cough Drop from him. Visit the
inn and talk to Konrad.

Visit the equipment shop. Talk to shopkeeper. Exit the shop and this
is followed by some more scenes. Things aren't looking good for
Snowe...

Make your way back to your room. You will meet Funghi at the walkway.

 Emerge victorious against the enemy pirates!

 There are 2 ships. One of the ship has a Fire Rune while the
 flagship has two Runes - Fire and Wind. On your side, you have Snowe
 commanding another ship.

 Paula    Underlings 10    Rune: Wind
 Keneth   Underlings 10    Rune: Lightning
 Jewel    Underlings 8     Rune: Water

 Since both the ships have Fire Rune on their side. Jewel is an obvious
 choice as Water is strong against Fire. Choose Tal or Kneneth as your
 second Rune ability. For my case I opt for Tal as I haven't been using
 him for my previous missions and he is in a low level.

 Have Snowe to fight the main flagship while your crew focus on Pirate
 Ship B. Attack with your Water Rune Cannon. While Snowe and Dario are
 wrecking the hell out of each other. Get into range and fire with your
 Water Rune Cannon. This is quite an easy naval battle.
 ____________________________________________________________________

This is followed by some more cutscenes... and you will be given the
following prompts:

a) We've got to help Snowe. Hurry!
b) I guess we have no choice...

Pick the top option. This is followed by some more cutscenes. Both
Hero and Snowe has been summoned to Glen's room. You will have some
cutscenes. Exit the room and there will be a cutscene between Snowe
and Hero. Make your way to the room and examine your bed. Pick the
bottom option to sleep.

Once you are awaken, proceed to Kitchen and talk to Funghi. You will
recieve the Commander's Meal again. Make your way to the commander's
room. There will be another cutscene and a piece of bad news... Exit
the room.

After a series of scenes, Katarina will join your party!

a new outfit (which looks much cooler that slobbish knight outfit)
and two crew members will visit you. If you pick Keneth and Jewel, you
will see Tal and Paula visiting you. 

Hero will be left abandoned on the ship and you will be rejoined with
your members that you have selected previously. There will be a
couple of cutscenes and you will meet another new friend, Chiepoo.

Items:   Treasure Map, Medicine, Dragon's Bone, Dragon Scale

Set sailed and fight a couple of random battles...

 ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 Enemies: Wild Seaweed, Muddy Fish, Fly Lizard
 ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

You will get a couple of equipment changes too. Hero will get the
classic Twin Fang weapon and he will deal two hits instead of the
normal one hit. After 2 random battles, this is followed by a
cutscene. You meet Colton, an old geezer ^_^). Talk to the knight
dressed in a black cloak. Head for the Cabin and talk to Colton.
Choose to rest...

Search the desk for a Treasure Map. Exit the cabin. There will be a
cutscene and you will fight...

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   ???                         HP: ????           Potch: N/A
   Colton                      HP: ????

   You can win the battle as the mysterious man and Colton deals
   around 200 HP per attack.
  
   Items: N/A
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

You will get some cutscenes and you will find that the mysterious
man is actually Sir Troy (Haven't you been paying attention to the
"history classes" before?)

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Kooluk Soldier A            HP: 180            Potch: 400p
   Kooluk Soldier B            HP: 180

   The battles are started to getting tougher. The Kooluk
   Soldier has the ability to use Clay Guardian. It takes around
   4 hits to finish them off.
  
   Items: Medicine
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Move around a bit and you will fight another 2 more soldiers and
you will be back on the exile ship. Set sail for while fight a random
battle against 2x Fly Lizards and a big one is coming...

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Water Dragon                HP: 1300             Potch: 1000p

   The battle is quite hard as the boss is quite strong. Its
   wind slash attack does around 40 to 50 HP damage to all allies
   & it's zap breath does around 18 HP damage along with the
   sleep status. Just keep your character's HP above 40 and 50
   HP. Have Chiepoo to use the Steamed Bun to restore HP while
   if your allies have Kindess Drops water Rune spell, it helps
   a lot in the battle.
  
   Items: Dragon Scale, Dragon's Bone
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

You will blown off and end up on a deserted island.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Deserted Island
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:   Necklace, Lucky Ring, Water Amulet, Guard Ring, Crab Bun,
         Giant Crab's Shell, Seashell, Shell
Potch:   3280p

Everyone will be lying on the ground unconsicious. Talk to everyone
twice and they will rejoin your party and a member will suggest that
you should take a look around the vicinity.

The first path behind the save port leads to a Dense Forest. Head
north and move pass yellow marker and you will find a Necklace
headgear. Equip it on Chiepoo. The southern end leads to the edge
of island.

The northeast path leads to the Boulder Shade where is nothing on
there. Return back to the beach and take the northwest path. Enter
the cave and head north twice. You will have reached the Subterranean
Lake area. There is a green cloudy point - that's a recover point.

Once you have visited all areas, it will trigger another cutscene and
you will be given 2 prompts:

a) Then we'll have to escape
b) This place doesn't seem so bad.*

(If you pick the bottom option and choose another 2 times. It will
 lead to the bad ending.)

Day 1
--------
Choose to the first option. Chiepoo will volunteer to take care of
food and you will assign your tasks.

1) Cutting down the trees
2) Make some rope
3) Collect cocunuts

You will find Chiepoo on the beach and he will offer the same items
that you can bought at the exile ship.

Gather Cocunut   - Head for the edge of the island. You will find
                   coconuts on the patch there. (Cocounut)
Cut down Trees   - Head for the Dense Forest and proceed to Hill
                   area. Search for trees with a glowing spot. (Wood)
Make some rope   - Search the beach for for Old Rope

Once you have gather 3 of the objects, make your way to the cave.
Be careful as there are random battles here.

 ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 Enemies: Pearl Crab (cave), Giant Bat (cave), Wild Crab (forest)
 ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Make your way to the Subterranean Lake and it will trigger a cutscene.
Hero will meet a mermaid who ran away the moment she saw Hero. Move
north and pick up the blinking object where you will get a Lucky Ring.

Exit the cave and gather your members. Visit the Boulder Shade and
you will be able to choose to rest and you will get some cutsenes.

Day 2
--------
You will allowed to assign tasks again. Choose a different one. Won't
you be bored if you choose same task? Once you are done with the task,
visit the Subterranean Lake. The mermaid will leave you another
accessory - a Water Amulet. Exit the cave. Proceed to Boulder Cave
and choose to rest.

Day 3
--------
Do a different assignment. Make your way to Subterranean Lake and
you meet the Mermaid for the 3rd time.

a) I will do none of that
b) Are you asking me to?

Choose the top option. Pick up the blinking object and you will get
the last accessory from the mermaid - a Guard Ring. Gather all your
members and choose to rest.

Well, your ship is ready and it loosk pretty weird IMO... Talk to
your members and you will find Chiepoo is missing. The mermaid comes
out and blurting out funny stuff at your party...

Make your way to the Hill vai the Dense Forest and you will find
Chiepoo being chased by crabs and you will fight...

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Wild Crab A                 HP: 90               Potch: N/A
   Boss Crab                   HP: ????
   Wild Crab B                 HP: 90

   Destroy the wild crabs first and attack the Giant Crab with
   your normal attacks. 
 
   Items: N/A
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

This is followed by a cutscene and you will be given the following
prompt:

a) "I'll try using the power of the Rune!"
b) "I can't use the power of this Rune!"

Pick the top option. The boss will become exposed and 6 more wild
crabs appear on the map.

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Wild Crab A                 HP: 90               Potch: 3280
   Wild Crab B                 HP: 90
   Wild Crab C                 HP: 90
   Boss Crab                   HP: 1300
   Wild Crab D                 HP: 90
   Wild Crab E                 HP: 90
   Wild Crab F                 HP: 90

   Start off by casting Berserk Blow which should eliminate all
   the wild crabs with 1 blow. While the remaining 2 characters
   attack the boss. The crab has two main attacks - a breath
   attack that does around 45 HP damage to a single character
   while breath type attack that does around 30 HP damage to all
   allies. By this time, Hero should have a Kindness Rain if his
   level is around level 24. Use it when your party's HP is
   critical low. As like before Chiepoo does not have any Rune,
   thus have him use items to heal the wounds. Focus all your
   attacks and make use of attack spells especially Hero's
   Punishment Rune.
 
   Items: Crab Bun, Giant Crab's Shell, Seashell, Shell
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

You will be at dark hole again and you will fight the mysterious
shadow. Attack it. Hero will be finally awake after some scenes.
Talk to one of your allies and pick the first option.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
A new journey...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:   Water Rune Piece, Jizo Clock, Mega Medicine, Treasure Map
Potch:   1600p

There will be some scenes and you will know that the mermaid is called
Lilin. Set sail and fight 2 random battles and this is followed by
another boss fight:

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Killer Ray                  HP: 900              Potch: 1600
   Killer Ray                  HP: 900

   The killer ray looks like sting ray to me. They have a
   combined attack that does 60+ HP damage to all allies.
   Therefore it is highly recommend that you killed one of them
   off first. The laser beam attack does around 40+ HP to one
   ally. When one of the Rays' HP is low, they can cast a
   restorative spell that cures around 40+ HP. That is the
   signal that one of the Rays is dying. Go for the killer.
   Attack spells are extremely useful. Use Hero's Eternal Ordeal
   if you have it.

   Items: Water Rune Piece, Jizo Clock, Mega Medicine
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Talk to everyone and your team will be saved by another ship. You will
meet Desmond and you will be given another prompt:

a) I'm Hero
b) ........

Pick the top option. Desmond got scared off as he looks into Hero's
left hand and you will meet Flare. Make your way to the cabin. There
is a save point where you can save your game. Search the desk behind
the princess for another Treasure Map. Talk to the princess. Talk to
everyone and lastly talk to Desmond. It will be continued with another
cutscene...

          (Trading Post, Lottery Shop)_/


- Town Square A -
Well, it has been a long since you have seen such scenery. At the
southwest corner is the Trading Post. There is a merchant and you can
pay 100p for some information. It is about discarded ancient books
with Na-Nal. There are 3 shops in this area. You will find Yu, a
doctor where you need to pay 500p for him to heal your status
ailments. Next, to the appraiser shop is another Lottery shop. The
appraiser is Nabokou whom you can recruit later in the game.

Talk to the girl next the shop and you can get a Lottery Ticket!
(And surpisingly, your characters can equip it as an headgear.) Take
the pathway that leads from the lottery shop.

- Town Square B -
In this part of area, there are 2 woman at the washing bay along with
Ornan. Talk to the lady dressed in pink and you will get a Soap. Within
the same area, you will find the smithery and the armor shop. You can
upgrade your character's weapon to level 6. Don't be shocked to see
your potch being used up quickly. Move up the stairs and it will lead
to the area where you see a deserted area.

- Town Square D -
Make your way up the stairs and you will reached an area with two
large buildings. There is a guy being trapped inside in the house on
the right. Now take the north path up and you will reached the Palace.
Now take the path south and head to area C.

- Town Square C -
There is a Inn on the left hand side of the area. The equipment is in
the middle and it is advisible to get some Escape Talisman, which can
be very useful when you fighting in dungeons. Visit the Rune Shop and
equip a Rune for Chiepoo.

   ***************************************************************

- Palace -
There is a man in the courtyard. Talk to him and head north. The
northwest path leads to the ruins, which is unaccessible at this point
of time. Enter the palace.

You will meet Setsu at the Antechamber and followed by Princess Flare
and Desmond. You will also meet the King of Obel - Lino En Kludes and
you will receive the Ruins Entry Permit, which allows you to access
the ruins. Next Lino will tell Desmond to bring you to your new "home".

Talk to the path heading northwest.

- Cliff Path -
 ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 Enemies: Killer Rodent
 - Be careful as the Rodents are able to perform a suicide attack
   that could instantly kill a character!
 ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Just move north up the cliff path and you will reach a cave. Well it
turns out to be a base. You will meet Louise who will be guarding the
saloon of yoru base. She will join you along with Tov and Chadli.
From now onwards, you can start recruiting 108 stars of destiny, a
tradition that has been present in the Suikoden series. One of the
old Knights of Gaien member will talk to Hero and you will be given
the following prompt:

a) You're right. Let's do our best
b) Living on this island might be fun too.

Pick the top option and your members will left your party. Talk to
Louise and you can choose to stay in the inn or save your game. Talk
to her and you can setup your party members. You can even have Louise
as a support character. Now make your way up the stairs and proceed to
Hero's room. Go and rest... You will have another cutscenes. Go down
the stairs and talk to Desmond and you will find out that you can use
the patrol ship. If you have added Louise as your support member, you
can talk to Desmond to reform your party. Head for the Saloon and talk
to Louise to form your party.

Now you have 2 choices. The first one is go and wreck the ruins, which
is unadvisable as the enemies are really tough there or do some
exploration using the patrol ship, which is at the harbour. Hence,
let's do some side quests, gains some levels and upgrade your
equipment!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Town of Obel
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:   Seashell
SOD:     Ornan (#64) - Wool Loincloth, Shin Guards

Exit your base and there will be some cutscenes. Visit the palace and
talk to the granny at the antechamber for a Seashell. You will find
Noah and you can play a card game ranging from 500 to 5000 and it is
a tough one unless you know the rules. Exit the antechamber and you
will find Ema and Gary at the courtyard. Head for the washing area
and talk to Ornan.

All right
That would be a little...

Choose the top option and he will join your party.

    LV 11                              Notes:
    Ornan               STR   29       You cannot disarm the Waking
    HP:   130/130       SKL   34       Rune from Ornan. He starts off
    MP:   LV 1:  3/3    MAG   30       in Sleep status and can only be
          LV 2:  1/1    EVA   22       awaken once he was hit by a
          LV 3:  0/0    PDF   30       physical attack.
          LV 4:  0/0    MDF   33
                        SPD   40
    ATK   49   DEF  30  LUC   42

   Initial Equipment:
   Wool Loincloth, Shin Guards
   Runes:  Waking Rune
   Weapon: Sheep's Horn
   WPN LVL    1
   WPN PWR    20

(If you want him in your party, go to your base and talk to Louise or
 Desmond to change your members)

Proceed to the harbour and talk to the guard. Don't bother to head
anchor your ship as there is nothing to take. Do not head too far off
Obel otherwise your character will be in trouble if you encounter
enemies that are too strong for your party. I would recommend you to
get everyone's weapon level for your current party to level 6 and best
defensive equipment for everyone in your current party. Bring Louise
as your support party.

 ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 Around in the World

 The world of Suikoden is bound by endless seas and surprisingly when
 you reach the "borders" of the map, your ship will automatically
 U-turn. As your party isn't quite strong at the moment, I suggest
 you to travel within the area where you find Obel, Mordo Island, Nay
 Island and Na-Nal.

 Please note that HP are based on my estimations. Apparently, enemies'
 HP will gain as Hero and his parties level up.

 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 Enemies: Speckled Ray, Jellyfish Man, Poison Lizard (near Obel),
          Giant Bat (near Obel), Fly Lizard (near Na-Nal), Damp
          Hairball (near Na-Nal), Demon Hairball (east of Obel)
          Spiny Grecko (east of Obel), Leviathan (rare)

 - Most of the time in the ocean, you will encounter Speckled Ray or
   Jellyman Fish. Avoid heading east of Obel at this point of time
   as your party are considered weak and you may encounter enemies
   that are beyond your reach and you may end up anchoring after a
   battle is over. Once you encounter the Leviathan, I recommend you
   to escape as it has a whooping 7000+ HP...
  ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mordo Island
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:   Treasure Map, Window Set 4

The small pointed hilly island is located a bit northwest off Obel.
Sail until you find a brown pointy island. Board it and you have
reached Mordo Island. If you observe carefully on the map, there is
a pitch of brown colour surrounding that region. If you still have
problem in getting the world, please refer to the world map that can
be found at GameFAQs <http://www.gamefaqs.com>

 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 Enemies: Killer Rodent, Paradise Bee, Blue Rodent, Yellow Rodent,
          Red Rodent, Rodent Leader

 - Killer Rodents has a high possibility to inflict a suicide attack
   that kills one character and itself. Hence, take note.

 - Paradise Bee's attack can cause Poison.

 - The Rodents could inflict the balloon status on your characters.
   They will normally appear in gangs of either one of these 2
   formations:

 Formation #1
 Rodent Leader x2 & Yellow Rodent x2
 Items: Stone of Speed, Wind Rune Piece, 1360p
 This is more common formation that you will like to encounter while
 on Mordo Island. Just attack the Rodent Leaders first and finish off
 the remaining Rodents.

 Formation #2
 Rodent Leader, Yellow Rodent x2, Blue Rodent x2, Red Rodent x2
 Items: Stone of Magic, Wind Rune Piece, 2520p
 If you saw this combination of enemies, start to use an attack
 spell especially Hero's Double-Edged Swd if you have it. Since the
 purpose of battling in Mordo Island is to gain levels and training.
 You can also use Rush attack (when the yellow bar below the character
 status is maxed out)
 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

You will encounter random battles while on the island and they aren't
easy unless your members are around level 25 and above. There are 2
tents on the harbour planks. One of them leads to a hot springs where
you can go for a dip to restore your lost HP and MP while other one
is a trading post. There is an informant who will offer you some
information when you paid him 100p. Search the baskets behind the
Hot Spring Tent and you will get another Treasure Map. There is a
chest behind the trading post and you can get Window Set 4 item.

  All right, all right! I'm starting to get into it!! I'm gonna to
  kill you!! Choose Guard and it is over..

  It is very lucky if you get this on the first time. Beacause Hero
  will just kill her with one hit if you choose Guard and Full
  Power. This scenario appears to happen only if Hero is slightly
  wounded in the battle.

  Quote                                              Use
  First Let's see how good you are!               -> Attack
  You're dead!!                                   -> Guard 
  Hahaha not yet, not yet!                        -> Special
  Whew, I'll see how it goes far a bit            -> Attack
  Come & get me!                                  -> Attack

  If you lose, you need to pay 1000 potch!

* I got these stats when I return back to the base in Obel.

The path on the most right hand corner leads to an empty jail with a
treasure that you can't access it at the momment. The northeast path
leads to the Gorge where you will have some storyline event The
lefthand most path leads to the Chief's house. Visit it and you
will find a chest containing Stone of Strength, which adds +1 to a
character's attack permanently. I would normally opt this for the main
lead. Use it on Hero.

It is time to make your way back to Obel...

         Talisman
Potch:   7500p
SOD:     Ragki (32) <support - found treasure>
         Rikie (33) <support - healing>

 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 Enemies: Unicorn, Skeleton, Killer Rodent

 - Unicorn can perform a spell-type attack that does around 75 HP to
   one ally or 35 Hp to all allies. When you spot one, kill it off
   first!
 - Skeletons will appear in groups and they will sometime in a mix
   along with Unicorn. They will be killed only when all enemies in
   that battle has been killed.

 These enemies are tough. Make sure that you have ample supply of
 Medicine and conserve your magic especially Hero's Eternal Ordeal
 which is an excellent magic against the boss.
 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The ruins can be accessed via the path on the left from the Palace.
You will find a boy there. He is Ragki and he will be your tour guide
in the ruins.

The ruins is rather complex but it is nowhere as complex as ruins in
other games like Final Fantasy. In the first area, make your way down
the stairs that are close to the door way. The path in the lower area
leads to a chest containing a Thunder Amulet. Return back to the main
area and you will find another chest nearby. It contains 5000 potch.

Move the stairs and move towards the pathway leading north and you
will have a cutscene. You will find out that Ragki is first time
here... (Feel unsafe?) Move through the pathway.

There is t-junction here. The path leading towards right will allow you
to get a chest containing a Magic Hand. Make your way towards left. You
will find an angled pathway similar to the one that you seen before
entering ruins. There is a pathway and a split path with a chest nearby
it. The chest contains a One-Piece Dress. The pathway in the north leads
to a chest which contains an Angel Hairball, which is way too strong for
your party at the moment. (Hint: It has 3000 HP!)

Choose to retreat if you accidentally open the treasure chest. Take the
split path leading from the chest. You will find another walkway with a
split path. Take the split path and you will reach a bending junction.
Move and you will reach an area similar to the one that you have been
to earlier.

your game. Take the path leading right from the save point. You will
reach a bending junction. Once in the next area, you will find another
t-junction. The path on the right leads to a chest containing a Mega
Medicine. Move towards the other side or retrace back your pathway to
the save point & head for the boss meeting point. Upon reaching that
spot, Ragki will comment on an incoming aura...

   Guard              HP: 1500                       Potch: 1000
   Do not use all your spells as there is a 2ND battle after a
   series of cutscenes unless you intend to use Mushrooms to
   restore HP. I got 6 Lv1 MP for Hero. Hero's Eternal Ordeal
   works extremely well. It has a crystal shell attack that does
   around 90 HP damage to an ally along with a sonic wave attack
   that does 70 HP damage to all allies. Just keep your
   character's HP above 150 HP and you will be fine.

   Items: ? Ornanment (Good Luck Cat), Platinum

 Enemies: Killer Rodent, Rodent Leader, Yellow Rodent, Red Rodent,

 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Move up the area and you will reach the inner ruins. There is a save
point. Use it and search the chest for 3x Mega Medicine, 3x Mushroom
and an Escape Talisman. Head north and in the new area.

You will find an old lady near a tree. Search the tree first for a
Treasure Map item. The lady is Rikie. Talk to her and there will
be scenes and you will learn more about the Rune of Punishment. Pick
any answer as you are being prompted. Search the tree for another
Treasure Map. Restore MP if you needed. Exit the area and you will
fight...

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Guard              HP: 2000                       Potch: 1500
   The boss have two large arms along with more hit points. Its
   mega punch does around 100 HP damage to an ally. Just dish
   out your strongest spell. Use Eternal Ordeal and followed by
   Rush to restore Hero's HP.

   Items: Diamond, Iron Hammer
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

After defeating the boss, you will be outside the ruins with Rakgi and
Rikie joins your party. Make your way to your HQ and you will meet
Manu there. Visit your HQ first before talking to him. Sleep and
restore some hit points. Save your game and you might want to bring
Rikie as your support character instead of Louise as it is more easy
to change members by talking to Louise than Desmond...

Exit your base and talk to Manu. Pick the top option and you will be
heading to the harbour in a split second! Board the ship.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Items:   Medicine x6

S.O.D:   Lilin (097) <accessory>

There will be a cutscene aboard the ship. You will meet Lilin. Move to
the big white dot on the compass (well, it is a bit too big...) This
is followed by a prompt:

a) We'll never hand her over to you!
b) I cannot do that.

Pick either one of the prompts and you will be forced to fight..

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Captain's Staff x3                                Potch: 600p
   It just took me less than 2 hits to finish off one of them.
   Hence it is an easy battle...

   Items: Medicine x3
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

This is is followed another...

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Captain's Staff x3                                Potch: 600p
   It is just like the previous one. No sweat.

   Items: Medicine x3
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

You will be given the following prompt:

a) Shoot them!!
b) Let them go.

The top option gives you a funny cutscene. Lilin will join your
party. Return the harbour and it will trigger a cutscene. It is
a naval battle!

                   Naval Battle #4 - Pirate Dario

 ____________________________________________________________________

This is followed by a series of cutscene. You will be introduced to
some new characters. Make your way back to the harbour. A soldier
will come and says that Desmond is looking for you. Make your way back
to the base. Talk to Desmond and Lino has a new mission for you, it is
to look for Oleg who resides at Nay now...

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Searching for Oleg...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:   Nothing
SOD:     Oleg (82) <inventor>
         Cedric (20) <support - found treasure)

Talk to Manu and choose to take his transport and you will be brought
to the harbour automatically. At the harbour, talk to the Obel guard
and choose to board it. This is followed by a cutscene...

Set sail for Nay which is north off Mordo Island. You might want to
bring in other members for training at this moment of time as you
can upgrade their weapons as well.

Once at Nay, proceed to the high ground where you find the Inn. There
is a pathway leading to there from the Village Chief's house. You will
find a man at the open field east off the Inn. Talk to him and you
will be given the following prompt:

a) Yes, I would love to see it
b) Not surprising they don't understand.

Pick either one of the options and you will be asked to stay for a
night at the inn. Make your way to the inn. You will be brought inside
the room with Oleg and this is followed by cool cutscene. Go to your
bed and sleep.

Once you have exit from the inn, check out the invention and make your
way to the harbour of Nay. Go to the beach and there will be some more
cutscenes. Make your way back to Obel.

At the Obel, proceed to the Inn and stay in the inn. Proceed to the
palace and it will trigger a cutscene. Talk to the lady. Chase after
him and surprisingly he is actually running towards your base ^_^. At
the base, talk to Louise. Eventually, Cedric will join your party!

Make your way to the palace.

         Akaghi (62) - Wool Vest, Silver Bracers  
         Mizuki (63) - Wool Robe, Shin Guards

Make your way to the Antechamber. A cutscene will follow. Eventually,
Oleg will join you! Exit the palace and make your way to the base
again. You cannot leave Obel at this point of time. Proceed to the
cliff path and it will trigger a cutscene and you will fight...

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Akaghi      HP: 600                               Potch: 940p
   Mizuki      HP: 600

   They are nowhere as hard as the previous bosses that you have
   fought. They are fast moving though and Mizuki has the
   ability to poison an ally with her attacks. If that happens,
   use an Antitoxin or Healing Wind to cure it.

   Items: Nothing!

There will be some cutscenes and apparently they are after the Rune
of Punishment. Make your way back to the palace. Lino will explains to
them about the consequences of possessing the Rune of Punishment.
They will join your party! Setsu seems a bit unhappy about Hero's
presence as he has caused a lot of trouble to Obel since he has arrived
here.

Exit the Antechamber and it will be nighttime at the garden. Make your
way back to the headquarters. While along the cliff path, you will have
another cutscene and eventually this prompt will shows up:-

a) No choice... I must use the Rune...
b) No! I can't use the Rune

(If you choose the bottom option thrice, it will lead to a bad ending
 and gameover...)

Choose the top option. Eventually, this is followed by another naval
battle

                   Naval Battle #5 - Defending Obel
 ____________________________________________________________________
 3rd Kooluk Fleet vs Obel Warship
 
 Victory conditions:
 Defeat the invaders of the Kingdom of Obel

 Both ships have 2 types of Rune shells. One has fire and wind and
 the other has wind and earth.

 You have 12 underlings by default. Equip 2 Fire Runes. Have your
 strongest party as your fighters. Just counter with Fire Rune as
 enemy attacks you. Fire is strong against Wind and nullifies Fire
 but you will still substain damage from Earth magic. Have at least
 60 Underlings for your ship. The enemy will attempt to board you
 i.e. attempt to enter your ship and forcing your fighters to fight
 them in a battle. It is an easy one. Fight fire with fire...
 ____________________________________________________________________

You will back at the dark hole again. You will fight Brandeau's Shadow
Just attack him. Back at your room. Make your way to the Saloon and it
will trigger and every one will talk about the Rune of Punishment.
Everyone is fighting for Hero *sob*

Stay for the night and recover the lost hit points. BTW, here is Mizuki

  potch.

Make some preparations and prepare to hit the town. You will see that
Kooluk empire is attempting to invade Obel. Now return back to your
base and you will find everyone is missing. Proceed to the War Room
that is located at the 1st Floor passageway. There will be a couple
of scenes and you will know that the base is actually a ship. You
need to recruit some and Flare will join your party.

Your objective is locate some people and most importantly a doctor.
Proceed to the garden outside the palace and you will find that Ema
and Gary will not be leaving with you. You can't access the ruins
until you have gather everyone...

Proceed to the town and search the area for a man dressed in green
that is near the inn. This is followed by a cutscene of everyone has
deserting the town and they are making preparations. The inn owner &
Rune master are gone and you can still buy items. Proceed the washing
area. The smithery is still around. You can try to upgrade Flare's
weapon if you want. Talk to the women at the washing area and they
will leave for the ship. It trigger some scenes...

Make your way to the lower part of the town. You will find Adrienne
near the trading post. Talk to him and he will join you. Talk to Yu
too. He is the doctor you are looking for. Everyone has deserted the
shops. Proceed to the harbour.

At the harbour, talk to the man dressed in blue and Flare will tell
Hero that they should return back to the ship. From this point onwards,
you will be able to access the ruins. Once you are done with your tour
with the princess, make your way to the base. Flare will leave your
party. 

Proceed to the war room and Setsu will stay with Flare. You will be
given the following prompt:

a) Let's go
b) Please give me a moment

Choose the top option and this is followed by some very amusing
cutscenes. Choose "Set Sail" and OBEL ship will be departing for its
first voyage. You will be on the deck. Talk to everyone and you meet
some new faces. Attempt to enter the bridge and you will meet Kika
again. She will ask you to meet her at Nests of Pirates. Before
heading that, there are a lot of exploration to do.

The ship is HUGE. It has five storeys of area for you to explore. It
is so huge that I could make a section for it (^_^). BTW, here is the
stats of your newly recruited players:

From this point onwards, you can have 3 parties - 2 parties will be
usable when you fought random battles on the ship and your main party
will have Hero as the compulsory members. There is a lot of
recruitment as your huge ship looks a bit empty. Choose anchor and
rest in your room. Attempt to exit and Tov will talk to you about a
hidden room...

Deck
-----
You will meet your first crew members - Chiepoo and the two Knights
of Gaien that you have recruited. Above the door that leads to the
bridge, you will meet Nico, who will be automatically recruited as
you gain control of OBEL ship. Proceed to the bridge and there will
be a stairs that leads to the 1st Floor Corridor

First Deck Corridor
-----------------------
You will find your room here along with Lino's room and a comment
box where people passed you their messages. There the door with a
inn sign leads to the Saloon and you will find Perrault's corner
- First Issue
  - Kingdom of Obel Occupied
  - Attention to Wanted Man!
  - Mother of Depression - Chapter 2

The door opposite the staircase leads to the deck. BTW, remember those
pots and objects that you can sent for appraisals at the appraiser
right? There is a desk in the room that allows you to place them for
decoration. You can also rest in your own room to restore lost HP.

Second Deck Corridor
----------------------
You will find the war room along with Desmond. Talk him and you will
be given the following options:

- I want to see the roster
- I want to change members
- Nothing

You can view the 108 stars of destiny chart by selecting first option.
You will meet Rakgi here too. The door opposite the war room leads to
the rear deck.

In the saloon area, you will meet Louise along with Ornan. Talk to
Louise and you will be given the following options:

Rest a little
Change members
No thanks, I'm fine

Third Deck Corridor
---------------------
You will reach the Boutiques area. It looks like a mini shopping to me.
You will find Adrienne there and you will be able to upgrade your
weapons to level 9! Besides upgrading weapon and attaching Rune pieces,
you can make equipment by combining materials that you have obtained
from battles.

Chadli will sell you items and equipment. Below is the shopping list.
Surprisingly, you can't sell items to him...

In one of the rooms, you will meet Chiepoo! The central big room leads
to the bath room but you can't use it until you have recurited
someone...

Fourth Deck Corridor
----------------------
There are series of rooms here. You will find the Doctor's room in the
first one that is closest to the stairs. In one of the rooms, you will
meet Rikie. The room in the most northeast corners leads to the
library where you will find Haruto and Oleg. Look carefully at the map
on the wall. Hope it helps... The doors on the left off the library
actually connects to each other...

Fifth Corridor

Check the door in the southwest corner (i.e. the one that I mark ? on
my map. There will be someone speaking and you will given the
following prompt:

a) C-Can I come in?
b) Who am I? Who are YOU!?

Pick either one of the options and you will meet Mao inside the room
and given the following prompt:

a) You're growing mushrooms on this ship?
b) Please join us!

Pick either one of the options and he will join you. If you visit the
Accessory Atelier, you will meet Lilin and she will be able to combine
raw items in accessories! The shipwright's room allows you to meet Tov
and customize your ship. In the training hall, you will meet Reinhold.
In the Rune Cannon Control room, you will meet Pablo.

Return back to your room and sleep again. As you exit, Tov will comment
on the Forbidden Room again. Visit and you will find Nao there. You can
have him joining you! There is nothing much to do except for doing some
exploration. Activate the menu and choose Depart. Please note that you
can save anywhere while on the ship.

 ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 Your navigation area has expanded and you will encounter tougher
 enemies if you sail a bit too far. I would recommend you to avoid
 the Razril region unless your party is around level 35. Keep your
 exploration within the middle and eastern region

 Enemies: Speckled Ray, Jellyfish Man, Poison Lizard (Obel), Giant
          Bat (Obel), Fly Lizard (Na-Nal), Damp Hairball (Na-Nal)
          Demon Hairball (Iluya, Donut), Spinny Grecko (Iluya, Donut),
          Red Ray (Iluya), Leviathan (rare), Metal Crab (Deserted),
          Rock Crab (Nest of Pirates)

 - A couple of new enemies is added to the list. But I would advise
   you to have a lot of magic users (who can cast group spells in
   your party when visiting Iluya or Donut region) as the enemies
   there are tougher than the ones you encounter normally.
 - Once you approach near Iluya, you will see that the sky is getting
   darker and starts to rain, that means you are close to Iluya.
 - If you encounter Leviathan on the battle, choose to escape as I
   stated earlier, it has a lot of HP.
 - Near the Deserted Island, you can encounter a larger version of
   the Rock Crab and it has around 4500 HP. So it might take sometime
   to kill it, but it is within your ability to take it down.

Make some preparations and you might want to upgrade Mizuki & Akaghi's
weapon before taking them out for battles. Talk to Adreinne and you
will hand over the Iron Hammer to him. Visit and read Perrault's
article and you read something about Bartholomew.

At the harbour, search the beach for a Message Bottle key item. It is
located near the shoreline of the beach.

Proceed to Nay-Kobold Settlement. Move pass the suspension bridge and
you will meet someone who appears out of nowhere (!). Enter the
settlement area.

Enter the settlement. Talk to Bang who is at the lottery post. Recruit
him. Proceed up the stairs and move into the residence house where you
meet Bartholomew earlier. Talk to him and you will be able to recruit
him. Exit Nay-Kobold and make your way to suspension bridge. You will

Make your way back to Na-Nal. Make your way to the Inn and you will
meet Manu. Pick the top option to recruit him! From this point
onwards, you will be use the elevator within your ship. Make your
way to the Rune Shop. Talk to Shopkeeper. Choose the second option
to meet the Rune Master. (Prepare some tissue paper...)

    LV 27                          Notes:
    Jeane               STR   50   You will be given 3 options. I
    HP:   189/189       SKL   86   would opt for Runes to put on

   Initial Equipment:              ask for Jeane again. Choose the

Make your way to the gathering square. There is a woman standing
alone in the center of the square. Talk her and you will fight...

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Maxine      HP: 2000                             Potch: 1000p

   This one can be a tough one if you are bring in a training
   party. Bring in a party where they have more 200+ HP damage
   or someone with the Earth Rune. She will start off by casting
   a couple of Earth spells - Clay Guardian. She is able to use
   Wind of Sleep and this is followed by a powerful wind spell
   - The Shredding. Prepare some Jizo Clock in case. She is
   quite tough in defense though.
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Return back to your ship and rest. Save your game and make your way to
Nay Island Harbor. Proceed to the Stonecutter's Area. You will find her
under a tree...

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Maxine      HP: 2500                             Potch: 2000p

   She is more tougher as she will use the Shredding more faster
   than the previous battle. Make sure someone in the party has
   the Kindess Rain spell. If Jeane is at a decent level, you
   will be beat her easily with her magic. Clay Guardian is
   extremely useful for this battle.
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Now, make some preparations for a long sea trip. Give your magic
characters some Lightning Rune. Bring in Jeane seems to be a wise
choice. Set sail southwest off Nay Town towards Middleport.
Eventually, you will find an island in between the pathway. Choose
to land there.

 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 Ocean (near Desert Island)
 Enemies: Jellyfish Man, Giant Bat, Speckled Ray, Metal Crab,
          Rock Crab

 - If you encounter a Metal Crab, you are in luck. The enemy has
   very strong defenses and its attack does tremendous amount of
   damage to an ally. As being a sea creature, it is extremely weak
   against Lightning. Soaring Bolt/Eternal Ordeal works extremely
   against it
 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

There is nothing much to do other heading for the island..

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Deserted Island
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:   Taisuke's Clothes
SOD:     Taisuke (104) <bath>
         Lilen (55) <accessory>

 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 Enemies: Pearl Crab (cave), Giant Bat (cave), Wild Crab (forest)
 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The place should look familiar to you. It is the same place that you
have stay for three nights and meet Lilin. Make your way into the cave
and proceed to Subterranean Lake. You will see a speech box and it
seems someone is undressed (oops ^_^)

You will be at the Subterranean Lake. Use the recovery point and make
your way outside. He will remind you to bring his clothes to him.
Outside the cave, you will find a green bundle. Check it and you will
get Taisuke's Clothes. Return back to the lake area and talk to him
Hero will hand over his clothes. Exit the cave and re-enter again and
return back to him. He will be dressed up and you will be able to
recruit him. He will be at the bath area. You can have private baths
at your ship!

Re-enter the cave and proceed to the Subterranean Lake AGAIN. You will
find another mermaid. She is Lilien. Choose the top option as your
reply and she will joins you!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Iluya Island
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:   Ocean Rune Piece x2, Treasure Map x3, Chinchilla Stand,
         Simple Wallpaper, Old Book Volume 7
SOD:     Nataly (75) <window set>
         Kate (79) - Linen Outfit, Shin Guards
         Izak (6) - Wool Vest

Preparations
--------------------
Make your way to Nay-Kobold Settlement (use the magic mirror) and
head for the trading post. Purchase a flower seed. Bring Mizuki in
your party. Train your party around level 35 and you will be fine.

Iluya is just directly north off Nay Island. The distance isn't quite
far. As you are approaching the area, the area tends to get foggy.
This means you will start to encounter new enemies on top of the
normal enemies that you encounter.

Harbour
-------------------
You will encounter random battles as you move in this area.

 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 Enemies: Stun Lizard (destroyed town), Bloody Behemoth (destroyed
          town), Kooluk Soldier (advanced base), Kooluk Archer
          (advance base)
 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Move up the stairs and you will find an Ocean Rune Piece along with a
Treasure Map from the chest. Move forward and you will find another
chest near the gates containing a Chinchilla Stand. Make your way to
the next area

Kooluk Advanced Base
----------------------
There is a chest containing a Angel Hairball. I recommend you to
challenge it later. Check out the building. You will find a chest
containing another Ocean Rune Piece and Treasure Map. Check the knight
sword near the crate at the northeast corner for a Simple Wallpaper.
Outside the building, search crates located just opposite the base.
You will find another Treasure Map!

Destroyed Town Area
---------------------
There is another chest containing a Angel Hairball. Retreat currently
as the enemy is way too strong for the time being. You will find a
a woman in this area. She is Nataly and you will be given the following
prompt:

a) Was it because of the Kooluk attacks? 
b) ...

Choose the top option and you will eventually be prompted to recruit her.
Enter the other part via the area marker.

Destroyed Town Area
---------------------
This is a circular maze but you should have no problem in moving around.
There is a chest within the area containing an Old Book Volume 7. Make
sure you don't miss it. In the center of the town, there is a man with
a large sword on his back. He is Izak. Talk to him and you will be given
the following prompt eventually.

a) Let us fight together!
b) ...

However, he would request you to bring him a Flower Seed. Talk to him
again and you will hand over your flower seed that you have bought
earlier from Nay-Kobold. In the eastern region of maze, search for a
woman. Talk to her and you will be given a prompt. Introduce yourself.
She will ignore you if you did not bring Mizuki along. If Mizuki is
in your current party, you will be able to recruit here.

Remember the mysterious bottle? You can located the island which is
located east off Obel. Hence head south from here. There is an
island that is shaped like a donut. Enter. Apparently, there isn't

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Donut Island
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:   Treasure Map, Rage Orb
SOD:     Rene (66) <treasure hunting>

 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 Enemies: Fishman
 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

On the island, you will find a girl in the middle and that's all ^_^.
Talk to her and you will be able to recruit her and she will give you
a treasure map. Board your ship, anchor and head for the library which
located on Fourth Deck Corridor. She is in the room where you find
Oleg and Haruto. Talk to her and she will analyze the map that she
given you and you will be given a tutorial on her mini-game - treasure
hunting?

Remember those treasure maps that you have gathered earlier? They are
actually maps for Rene to analyze and you will be able to find them.
Upon her analysis, you need to head back to Donut Island. Make use of
Viki's magic mirror and head there or you can choose depart from your
menu and make 360 degrees turn back into the island. Do as she says
and you will get a Rage Orb which is an advanced version of Fire Orb.
Give it to a strong magic user.

You can come to the end of side quests. Time to proceed to the Nest
of Pirates which is located south off Obel.

Just sail towards the blue arrow indicated on your chart and you will
be able to find it. Once you are within the area, search for an
opening to the island and you will have a cutscene of entering the
island.

         Lilon (41) <accessory>
         Phil (71) <tailor>

If you have been following the walkthrough from the start till now,
you should have already recruited 40+ members by now...

Aboard the island, you will find an equipment shop and a smithery.
Suprisingly, the bargain finds will always nab a series of great
orbs and equipment...

Search the crates near the equipment shop and you will find a minature
chest. Check it and you will find another Treasure Map. Move towards
the lefthand most end of the pathway and you will find Pirate Bracers.
Equip it on Hero. Talk to the pirate that is standing near the shore.

Proceed to the cave and it is actually a bar. The inn will allow you
to stay there for 1200p per night (that's daylight robbery! But
remember that they are PIRATES.) Talk to Phil (if you have 40 members
or more recruited) and you will be able to recruit him. Proceed to the
room in the north and it leads to Kika's room. There is another chest,
search it and you will get a Treasure Map and a Ocean Rune Piece.

Talk to Kika or any of her friends (Sigurd, Hervey or Dario) and you
will trigger a cutscene. Eventually, you will be given the following
prompt:

I would recommend you to do something for these pirates as you will
need them for the upcoming battle. Upgrade their weapons to at least
level 7 and you will be fine.

Exit and sail around the area for a while. Return back the Nests of
Pirates.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Nest of Pirates Revisited!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:   Nothing!
SOD:     Lilon (41) <accessory>

Revisit the place and you will find out that a "guest" has arrived.
This is followed by some cutscenes and you will be given the following
prompt from Katarina

a) ...?
b) Then my name has been cleared?

Exit Kika's room and you will be back at the bar for more scenes. They
are talking about Scarlet Moon Empire's Elenor Silverberg. Some scenes
follow. Save your game and exit the bar. Go to shore, talk to Rikie
and choose to board your ship. This is followed by some scenes and
eventually a naval battle...

                   Naval Battle #6 - Former Friend
 ____________________________________________________________________
 Snowe's Army vs Hero's Army
 
 Victory conditions:
 Destroy all ships and stop Snowe's assault

 They have 2 ships and you have 2 too. One of the ship has lightning
 and earth while the other has wind and fire.

 Give Hero's ship - Fire, Earth, Lightning
 Kika's ship - Fire, Fire (replaced Nalleo with someone else
 stronger...)

 I was able to assign 3 Rune shells for OBEL as I got Hero to
 level 40 prior to fighting this. If you get too close to your
 enemies i.e. within 1 square, your fights on board will be forced
 to fight them. Don't bring character that based on magic as you are
 unable to use Runes. Bring attackers, characters like Bartholomew
 works well. Do not get your members killed or you will not be able
 to use for the remaining of game! Just keep on using Earth Rune
 shells against Snowe and Fire Rune shell against the other ship
 and you will be fine.

 ____________________________________________________________________

After the battle is over, you need to chase after Snowe to Razril. Make
your way to Razril (you will not be able to visit any towns at this
moment of time). Along the sea, you will encounter new battles which
you reach near Middleport or Razril.

 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 Enemies: Speckled Ray, Jellyfish Man, Poison Lizard (Obel), Giant
          Bat (Obel), Fly Lizard (Na-Nal), Damp Hairball (Na-Nal)
          Demon Hairball (Iluya, Donut), Spinny Grecko (Iluya, Donut),
          Red Ray (Iluya), Leviathan (rare), Metal Crab (Deserted),
          Rock Crab (Nest of Pirates), Ice Bird (Razril), Killer
          Fish (Razril)
 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Once you made contact with Razril and you will have several cutscenes
and eventualy this prompt:

a) Let the sea determine his fate.
b) You have one chance. Will you join us?
c) Execute him.

Pick the first option or second option. He will refuse to join you if
you pick the second option and still leave you anyway. I choose the
1st option. If you choose the 3rd option, Snowe will never appear on
the face of this world anymore...

Proceed back to the Nest of Pirates (yup it its a long way or you
can use the magic mirror...). Exit the area by boarding the ship via
talking to Rikie. Re-enter the Nest of Pirates and there will be a
message from Lilon and some cutscenes which eventually allows you
to recruit her.

Examine the blinking mirror and head for Iluya. Proceed to the smoky
harbor and find a stairs that leading downards, which just north from
the entrance stairway. You will find Liloon there. Use your glowing
hand mirror and teleport back Nest of Pirates. (If you have Kika in
your party, the pirates will treat you differently and you will be
able stay in the Inn for free!)

Head for the island marked by the blue marker - Hermitage Island.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Hermitage Island
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:  Mega Medicine x3, Skunk Orb, Green Bottle, Crest, Treasure
        Map x2, Copper Hammer, Earth Orb
SOD:    Agnes (85) <support - healing>
        Elenor (3) <tactician>

There is nothing much other than heading Hermitage Island, which is
just northwest off the Nest of Pirates. Once you get near it, it will
trigger a cutscene. Dario, Sigurd and Hervey will form part of your
party as compulsory members..

Move north from the harbor and you will reach the forest.

 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 Enemies:  Wild Leaves, Demon Wolf, Fossil Beast (Back Road)

 The enemies encounter will depends on Sigurd and Hervey's levels
 but the enemies will be wiped out instantly if Hero's weapon level
 is at level 9.
 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Move north off from the forest and there will be a cutscene. 

a) Are you Ms. Elenor?
b) Ms Elenor... You're quite young.

There will be a couple of cutscenes and some of them are very humorous.
Hero will have a chat with Elenor eventually.

a) Please fight with us!
b) I can't believe you drugged everyone!

Pick the top option. She wants you to bring everyone inside a box
found in the cave. Head back to the forest. Search the chest outside
the building for Mega Medicine x3 and Shunk Orb.

Back Road
----------
You will be alone using Hero. Make your way down the road. On the
next screen, you will face a...

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Horned Behemoth          HP: 750                 Potch: 3000p
   It has a normal punch attack, a somerault punch that does
   around 60+ HP. But it took me just 2 Eternal Ordeal to
   finish off because my Hero is at level 40. Just save up a
   couple of Mega Medicines, use it when Hero's HP is below 100.

   Items: Horn, Earth Rune Piece
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Make your way into the cave and you will reach the Limestone Cave.
Search the desk at the end of the path for a Green Bottle & Crest.
Search wine pots located on right side of the shelves for another
Treasure Map item.

Exit the cave and make your way back to Elenor's Room. Talk to Agnes
and you will hand over the Green Bottle. Hero will hand over the crest
to Elenor and you will be given the following prompt:

a) Yes.
b) I have no other choice.
c) ...

You will be able to access the Dirt Floor Room in Hermitage. Search
the stove for a Crab Bun and rest in her room for free! Exit via
the door here to the forest and there will be a cutscene with Agnes.
She will join your party! The chest in this area contains a Copper
Hammer. Inside small shed, there is a chest containing a Treasure Map.
Search the well for Earth Orb. Examine the door and you will head for
forest or using the magic mirror...

The leader is born...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:   Golden Seal

Make your party preparations. Proceed to the War Room. You will find
most of your crew members (or characters who join you as part of the
story there). This is follow by some cutscenes and Elenor believe that
there can ONLY be one leader and you will be forced to duel Lino one-
on-one. This is followed by this prompt:

a) W-Wait a minute
b) Then may the best man win

If you picked the top option, you have the luxury of not fighting
Lino and crown leader. If you choose the bottom option...

  -----------------------------------------------------------------
                  Fencing Battle #5 - Vs. Lino En Kludes
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  Well, this battle is quite easy as you are destined to win over
  Lino. Just use the respective commands as you see the quote...

  Quote                                               Choice
  All right, let's get right down it                - Special
  It's my turn next                                 - Special
  Okay, first, we'll see how things go...           - Attack
  I think I'll save my energy a little.             - Attack
  Come on! Let's see what you've got.               - Attack
  Hehe... Better be prepared for the next move...   - Guard
  Guess I'll start getting serious now...           - Guard

  -----------------------------------------------------------------

Once the duel is over and Lino will temporarily abdicate his throne
and give you the Golden Seal. Next you will be able to name the ship...

a) Let's go with Chicken
b) Let's go with Dauntless
c) I'll think up my own name

along with your army...

a) The Rush... I guess
b) The Hero Army... I guess*
c) I'll think up my own name

(*Hero will be replaced by the name that you have given to the main
  character.)

And lastly, pick the bottom option to launch the ship! To continue
with the quest, you can just return back to the War room and proceed
on or it is time to recruit some more characters!

* Bring in characters with high magic attacks for this battle

You can collect the items that you have missed earlier. Proceed to the
back road that leads to the limestone cave and you meet Aldo who is on
the road. Talk to him and you will be able to recruit him.

You can rest at Elenor's Room for free if you want to. Proceed back to
forest and loiter around for a random battle...

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Demon Wolf A             HP: 200                 Potch: 2500p
   Demon Wolf B             HP: 200
   Gau                      HP: 2000
   Demon Wolf C             HP: 200
   Demon Wolf D             HP: 200

   My level: 42
   The demon wolves can be wiped out singlely with an area-based
   base spell such as Burning Flames, Beserking Blow or even
   Hero's Double-Edged Sword. Just finished off his sidekicks
   first before going after Gau. Gau has only one attack - a
   three punch combo that does between 100 to 150 damage to an
   ally. Hence you need to keep your party's HP at a decent
   level. Besides he has a strong defense against phyiscal but
   is extremely weak against Magic. Use magic and you will be
   fine. If you intend to attack him with Hero's Eternal Ordeal
   keep an eye on Hero's health...

   Items: Bone x2, Skin x2

After the battle is over, you will be able to converse with the man
beast (Gau) and you will be able to recruit him by picking the 2nd

There is no much of interest on this. It is time to move on. Return
back to your ship. Proceed to your room and Desmond will say someone
is in your room. You will meet Lino, Elenor and Agnes along with the 2
pirates - Jango & Brec. Talk to them and they will join you!

Make your way to the Nest of Pirates. Visit Kika's room and you will
find Katarina healthy again. A cutscene will followed and this is by
a series of prompts. Pick the top option for both prompts and she will
joins you! Her equipment is the same that first time you use here.
She is still a level 11 character with a puny level 1 weapon. But she
can be powerful magic user once she is at a decent level.

Head for the holiday resort-like island - Mordo Island...

Visit the hot spring and you will meet Lo Fong and Lo Hak. They will
disturb you during your dip. When you are about to get out of the
spring, they will threaten you to pay them 10000p. Choose the first
option and you will fight...

(Lo Seng joins in the gang...)

   Lo Seng            HP: 1200                     Potch: 15000p
   Lo Fong            HP: 1000
   Lo Hak             HP: 1000

   The battle is really easy. It is a smart move to conserve
   your Rush attack so that you get a bonus turn. Their attacks
   does around 40+ to each ally and they are no danger in
   threatening your party since they are fully healed. Use 2
   Double-Edged Sword followed by a strong attack spell will do
   the trick.

  battle Maxine at the stonecutter's field (provided you have

Potch:   11200p
SOD:     Osakar (107) <support character - found treasure>
         Deborah (84) <support character - appraise>

At the war room, there will be a couple of cutscenes and your goal is
simple - unify the southern islands to face the enemies from the north
-Kooluk and your objective is recapture Razril. Elenor suggest that you
take care of the Middleport. Ramda will tend reminds you a monster
that live in the seas. Now make some preparations and set sail for
Middleport. It is a good time to train your magic users till they are
level 40 and set 3 parties of Rune magic users and they must be at
least level 35 because for the upcoming battle, melee-based attacks
(i.e. close range attacks) will be useless.

Save your game when you could see Middleport from your compass. Go
to your room and rest. Exit and make contact with Middleport. If you
fought a random battle before making to Middleport, use your other
ship party to attack it. Equip a strong magic user with the Rage Orb
and have her or him in your party.

There will be some scenes and a giant octopus attacks your ship with
its 4 tentacles:

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Tentacle A       HP: 500                        Potch: 11200p
   Tentacle B       HP: 500
   Moving Isle      HP: 3500
   Tentacle C       HP: 500
   Tentacle D       HP: 500

   The boss has a charge attack that deals between 40 to 90 HP
   to allies depending on characters' defense, a black spout that
   does 50+ HP damage to an ally along with sleep status & lastly
   the tentacles beam attack that does 100+ HP damage to all
   allies, which is only used when the tentacles are critically
   low HP.

   First of all, kill off all tentacles. If you do not do that
   these will unleash a deadly beam attack to all allies. One
   quick way is to use Rush (rush could still hit the boss).
   Unleash your magic at the tentacles. Lightning magic works
   extremely efficient against the boss. If you have 2 characters
   with level 4 spell (Thunder and Water), you unleash Thunder
   God which is extremely effective against the boss. Character
   who uses projectiles like Sigurd could still attack the boss.

   By the way, you can alternate between your main party and
   ship party for this battle. But it will be game over if
   either one of the parties is entirely wiped out.

   Likewise as the tentacles belong to the Moving Isle, if it is
   killed all tentacles will be wipe out too.

   Items:  Silk, Ocean Rune Piece
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

There will be a couple of prompts and Sigurd seem to be keen on going
for the visit. Ramada will accompany you. Hence bring Sigurd. You will
end up in the Middleport and you meet Mickey with Reinbarach III and
you will be given the following prompt:

a) I would like to open a business here
b) I would like a formal audience with him

Pick the top option. Reinbach III and Mickey will join your company.
You can return back to your ship and restore your lost HP and save your
game before hitting the town.

The shops are selling new items. Do not overspend and converse at least
10000p as you will need it to recruit a character here.

Well, you have completed the part for Middleport quest and the marker
will be indicated at Na-Nal. Before heading, do a headcount of your
characters and you should have more than 70 characters by now if you
have been following the walkthrough from the start.

Before doing that, go for a shopping spree at Middleport and get some
good equipment for Lino, Hero and another member who you intend to use
for the upcoming battle. I choose a magician (Viki) so that I could
utilize the the power of Rage Orb.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fog Ship (Have 70 characters recruited)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:  Pirate King Vest, Silk, Diamond
SOD:    Ted (4) - Soul Eater, Water Rune, Magic Robe, Magic Sandals

 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 Enemies: Death Blade
 - Like the Skeleton that you have encountered in the ruins, they
   can only be killed only when they are the last ones to be killed
   on that current battle.
 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Visit the War Room and there will be a cutscene between Hero and Ted.
This is followed by a cutscene and you will need to form a party of
Lino En Kludes and Hero along with another member. I choose a
character, with a strong magic stats and equipped her with the Rage
Orb. (Viki)

You will meet a Robed Man and he requests you to visit the ship's
captain. The pathway is very liner and straightforward. Just move
forward and you are unable to use Rush as you have only 4 members.

As you reached the end of the area and eventually you will fight...

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Death Blade      HP: 300                        Potch: 5000p
   Prophet          HP: 1000
   Death Blade      HP: 300

   Take out the Prophet first as the Death Blade will resurrect
   if you did not killed them last. The prophet could issue a
   beam attack that does around 100+ HP damage to all allies and
   an attack that causes poison status ailment to one ally.
   Conserve your magic (the final spells as there are much
   tougher battles coming on...). Have Hero uses his Double-
   Edged Sword...
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

There will be another cutscene and you will be given this prompt:

a) As long as I don't pass it on...
b) I do sometimes on...

Proceed past the marker and you will reach the next area. Walk on the
area and you will fight...

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Death Blade      HP: 300                        Potch: 7000p
   Prophet          HP: 1000
   Prophet          HP: 1000
   Death Blade      HP: 300

   There is an additional prophet. Kill off both prophets first
   as they can deal heavy damage to all your allies. Once they
   are out, focus on the Death blades. Have Hero uses his Double
   Edged Sword and it will be over soon...
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

There will be another cutscene:

a) But I shouldn't run away from it.
b) ...
c) It given so much thought...

Pick any of the options and you will head to meet the "captain" of the
ship. The boss will eventually give you this prompt:

a) I don't want to stay here all my life!
b) If I stay here, my life will never end?

Pick the top option and you will find out that the Robed Man turns out
to be Ted and he requests from the boss for the Soul Eater and you
will fight...

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Fog Ship Guide   HP: 7000                        Potch: 8000p

   The boss has a wide arsenal of attacks. It has an instant
   death attack. A beam blast that causes 100+ HP damage to all
   allies. It has a drain HP move that drains around 150+ HP
   from one ally. It has a single fire-like attack that does
   100 HP to one ally.

   First of all, use Rush, your gauge should be maxed out by
   now. Ted has a lot of water magic (9.5.3.1). Have him use
   Kindness Rain when all character's HP are low/critical. He
   can deal decent damage to the boss with his bow attack.
   Unleash your strongest attacks. Have Lino attack, Hero use
   his Eternal Ordeal while the third member unleash her
   strongest magic.

   Items: Silk, Diamond
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

After the battle, collect the Pirate King Vest from the chest (This
is your ONLY chance) and you will be able to view Ted's stats...

Exit the ship via walking (seize the opportunity to gain levels for
your current party) as you have Ted in your party and he is quite
strong. Try to test out his Soul Eater...

Once back on your ship, you will be able to recruit Ted. Choose to do
so and you will have one of the in-game best characters. Now proceed
to the blue arrow which is pointing at Na-Nal...

If you check out Chadli's shop, he is selling new items...

Of course, both Adrienne and the mermaid is able to made you better
armor and accessories. If you go and meet Phil, you can also have him
made you better clothing gear...

With Ted in your party, you can start serious training as his Soul
Eater Rune's Black Shadow is extremely effective and does around 400+
HP damage. To have him using it on first turn of the battle, give him
Speed Rings. Plus, you can earn double cash if you transfer Lo Seng's
Prosperity Rune on him...

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Na-Nal
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:  Graffiti, Old Book Volume 4, Elven Remedy
SOD:    Axel (7) - Iron Mail, Shin Guards
        Selma (8) - Scale Mail, Water

Make contact with Nay and there will be a cutscene at the doorway in
the 2nd deck corridor. Your party will comprises off Hero and Lino
along with 2 other members. Bring Ted and this section is going to
be a breeze walk...

Harbour
--------
From this point onwards, you will no longer encounter the past enemies
of bees and lizards instead you will battle Kooluk Soldiers...

 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 Kooluk Soldier        HP: 325 / 3300p     Items: Antiques*
 Kooluk Captain        HP: 425
 Kooluk Archer         HP: 325

 Their normal attacks may be weak but they can cause chaos if your
 party isn't properly trained as they could cast level 1 magic
 spells (Earth, Lightning and Ice) and Water Rune's Kindness Drops
 to restore health. But if you use Ted's Black Shadow from his Soul
 Eater Rune, you can wipe out them in one turn...

 *They will drop ? Pot, ? Painting and ? Ornament which turns out
  to be Voodoo Doll, Celadon Pot or Flower if you bring in Deborah
  as your support character.
 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Nothing has changed except that you will find 2 Kooluk Soldiers guarding
the entrance to the town. Make your way past them and you will be forced
to fight 2 consecutive battles...

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Kooluk Soldier A    HP: 325                      Potch: 2400p
   Kooluk Solider B    HP: 325

   The soldiers are weak but they could cast spells, so do not
   underestimate them and maintain your HP at a reasonable
   level.

   Items: ? Painting (Graffiti)
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

This is followed by immediately by another battle...

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Kooluk Soldier A    HP: 325                      Potch: 3600p
   Kooluk Solider B    HP: 325
   Kooluk Solider C    HP: 350

   This is similar to the previous battle except there is an
   additional Kooluk Soldier. Just wreck them hard and you will
   win this battle in no time...

   Items: Nil
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

This is followed by some cutscenes where Hero and his party meets
Axel and you will be given a task of getting something from the
elves. You will be given a place to stay... A prison! Make sure you
get the item from the chest, which contains an old Book Volume 4 as
this is your ONLY chance to get it. Examine the bench and choose the
top option. It will be nighttime and you will need to make your way
to the Great Elven Tree. All other paths have been locked and you
need to make your way to the Elven Tree. Take the pathway between the
village chief's house and the prison...

Gorge
---------
 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 Enemies: Rock Crab, Wicked Hen
 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

On this smoky mountain path, it is pretty linear and you just need to
move straight and you will reach the end of the path, which leads to
the Great Elven Tree. Search the altar located in north part of the
area for a Elven Remedy item. Take it. One of the paths leads to the
prison (got a bad feeling about this...)

Exit the area and you will be back at the Village Chief's house. He
was quite surprised that you got the remedy so easy and ask Axel to
ascort you out of town. After you have exit Seaside town, you will
meet an elf, Selma who stops you in pathway and eventually, you will
be locked inside the jail found in the Elven Tree. There will be some
more scenes. Sooner or later, you will be given this prompt:

a) You're plotting something...
b) What do you mean by that?

Talk to everyone in party and including Axel who is also locked with
you. Eventually, Selma break free the prison and allows your party to
escape. Head back to town and return back to Na-Nal. At the gathering
square, you will find out that Kooluk has launched an outslaught on all
citizens in Na-Nal and you will be forced to fight 3 consecutive
battles...

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Battle #1
   Elite Kooluk Soldier A  HP: 300                  Potch: 3000p
   Elite Kooluk Solider B  HP: 300

   Suprisingly, they are a lot more easier than the Kooluk
   soldiers that you have fought earlier. After this battle is
   over and you will fight...

   Battle #2
   Elite Kooluk Soldier A  HP: 300                  Potch: 4500p
   Elite Kooluk Solider B  HP: 300
   Elite Kooluk Soldier C  HP: 300

   Just one more Kooluk will not change the difficulty of the
   battle. Just use an area spell and you will be able to finish
   off this battle really fast...

   Battle #3
   Elite Kooluk Soldier A  HP: 300                  Potch: 4500p
   Elite Kooluk Solider B  HP: 300
   Elite Kooluk Soldier C  HP: 300

   Please refer to the strategy above or just unleash
   everything...
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

After the battle is over, you will meet up with the village chief and
given the following prompt:

a) We accept... Let's fight together!
b) Well if you insist.

Axel will joins you eventually. Exit the Gathering Square. At the
Hillside Town, you will meet Gunter who is standing the entrance that
leads to Seaside Town. Play a game of dice with him before moving on.

Make your way to the harbour and you will meet Selma who is standing
behind the trading post. Talk to her and you will be able to recruit
her. Exit and head for your ship. Your next stop is Nay Island.

Make your way to the Nay Island via ship. At the harbour, make your
way down to the beach and talk to the man there and he will tell you
about the man and woman from Iluya who are staying in village chief's
house.

Made your way to the village chief's house. Talk to him thrice and you
will be given this prompt:

a) Show him the Golden Seal
b) Don't show him the Golden Seal

Pick the top option and he will be convinced that Hero is the acting
King of Obel and you will be given another prompt:

a) Please may the people of Nay join us
b) Yes, Let us join forces and fight!

Pick either one of the option and you will be given another prompt:

a) ...
b) We can't take on that responsibility

Pick top option and he will tell you that there are 2 people who are
willing to join. Apparently they are the couple who are the
survivors from the Iluya disaster...

Exit the town and made your way back there. Revisit the village chief's
house and you will meet Kevin and Pam who will join you by picking the
1st option.

Now return back to your ship and replace 2 members of your current
party with Mitsuba and Reinbach. I will put Ted in the mix as he helps
a lot in fighting battles if you have not been training the previous
2 characters.

Use the Blinking Mirror and make your way to Middleport. You will find
a man in brown vest at the harbour. Talk to him and you will come to
know that Reinbach has a financee named Millay. Make your way back to
Na-Nal. You will find a woman being surrounded by 2 men. Make your

Make some preparations and you can training most of your characters
using Ted and Hero.

 ==================================================================
 Training Tip
 ==================================================================
 In order for this trick to work, you must recruit the Lo brothers
 at Mordo Island along with Ted. Transfer Lo Seng's Prosperity Rune
 and give it to Ted for his Rune head slot. Battle the Kooluk
 Soldiers at Na-Nal Island Harbour and you will get 6600 potch each
 time (Prosperity Rune doubles the amount of potch gained after the
 battle). For a quick kill, give Ted a Speed Ring [20000p and you
 can buy it your equipment shop (Chadli's)]. Ted should have his
 first turn and have him using his Soul Eater Rune's Dark Shadow
 and you will be able to wipe out those Kooluk soldiers in a turn
 while gaining decent HP, 6600p and sometimes ? ornaments, ?
 paintings or ? pots where you can appraise them and sell them for
 even more money. For instant appraisal, have Deborah as your
 support member. After 4 battles, you have sufficient cash to get
 another speed ring for Hero or more for Ted...

 Using this training tip also prevents low HP characters like
 Eugene, Rita or Ornan (if you haven't train them often) from dying
 to easily. By the way, Eugene is a lot more stronger than you can
 expect once you got him a decent level.
 ==================================================================

Get some decent armour for 8 fighters (prefer those that are fighters
like Bartholomew and have them around level 40 with defense around
150 and above) and you will be fine. Gau could wreck chaos if he is
at a decent level. Upgrade the 8 fighters' weapon to at least level 9.

Once your preparations are done, make your way to the war room and
Elenor and there will be a cutscene and eventually this prompt:

a) Are we taking Razril for Gaien?
b) I see... Then let's hurry

(S) Save your game

Pick the 2nd option and make your way to Razril. Choose to use the
glowing hand mirror and teleport your party to Middleport. Move
northwest from there and make contact with Razril. Transfer a Earth
Rune onto Jeane, Viki or Katarina. Bring your original party - the
2 Gaien Knights along with Katarina as your party members. (Sounds
logicial to have them heading back home first...)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Recapturing Razril

Items:   Platinum x5, Hero's Shield, Treasure Map, Guardian Bracelet,
         Silver Hammer, Window Set 9
SOD:     Helmet (51) - Iron Helm, Iron Mail, Iron Boots, Iron Shield
         Any 2 characters - (Jewel, Tal, Keneth, Paula)
         Basil (95) <tops mini-game>
         Maxine (96) - Feather Robe, Cyclone & Fire Rune
         Konrad (24) - Wool Robe, Rage Rune
         Funghi (92) <cook>
         Ameria (67) - Silver Chain, Iron Boots

         Gretchen (23) - Silver Chain, Kite Shield
         Frederica (48) - Silver Chain, Leather Boots
Potch:   1340p

The screen will switch to the war room where Hero alone with Elenor
and you will be given a prompt. Pick the second option and you will
have another naval battle!

 You have the Grishend along with the Dauntless (or Chicken if
 you choose to accept Chiepoo's suggestion ^_^) for your ship's name.
 Assign the eight strong fighters on your ships. Have Ted and the
 magician that I suggested earlier for the othe Rune. In other words,
 have Water and Earth Rune shells equipped.

 At the start of the battle, move your party in order and grow them
 close together. Do not attack the Gaien Ship at all. Attack Kooluk
 Ship B with your Earth Rune cannon and the Gaien Ship should switch
 sides and help you to fight Kooluk Ship A! It took me less than 2
 turns to knock down Kooluk Ship B. Once you are done with ship B,
 proceed to on and assist the Gaien Ship. Attack it with your Water
 Rune Shell (for my case the computer will always use Fire Rune maybe
 because Gaien Ship has been attacking it with Lightning or Earth
 Rune.) In no time, victory will be yours...
 ____________________________________________________________________

Once the naval battle is over, Helmut, the commander for the Kooluk
fleet surrenders and you will be able to recruit him. Pick the top
option and you will be able to recruit him. If you choose the 2nd
option, you will be no longer able to recruit him...

You will meet your old friends and it seems everyone is welcoming Hero
back. You will meet your other 2 friends (Tal, Paula, Keneth or Jewel)
and you will be able to recruit them! You will be given a similar prompt
that you have received from Katarina...

a) I didn't kill him
b) ...

Your ship will be dock in the harbour at the Razril Port. In the nearby
area, you will find a chest. Search it and you will get 5x Platinum!
Proceed up the main street and talk to everyone there. At the Town
Square, talk to Basil and you will be able to recruit him by picking the
top option. Proceed to the Inn and you will find Maxine (if you have
defeated her earlier in Na-Nal's Gathering Square and Nay -
Stonecutter's Field). Talk to her and you will be able to recruit her
if you choose bottom option as your reply.

Talk to Konrad who is at his usual spot since you left Razril and talk
to him. He will join you if you have Katarina in your party. Pick the
top option and you have one of the game's best magicians. At the back
street, you will no longer encounter any random battles...

Make your way back to town and talk to everyone you met on the streets.
The shops are selling better equipment and hence it is wise to stock
them up...

 *********************************************************************

You will meet Fredica at the equipment shop and she says that she is
looking for someone. Make your way to the Hall of Knights and make your
way to the Training Hall. There will be a cutscene and Elenor will allow
you to make a speech...

a) Everyone, let us fight against Kooluk!
b) ...

Pick the top option and you will be heading out of the Hall of Knights
and Snowe's dad will interrupt you and it is a battle...

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Gaien Soldier A   HP: 350                        Potch: 1340p
   Gaien Soldier B   HP: 350

   Just wipe them out with your normal attacks and you will be
   able to finish them off. A really easy battle.

   Items: Nothing!
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

This is followed by some cutscenes and you will be at the courtyard
and it is in the evening. Proceed to your room and save your game.

(S) Save your game.

At this point of time, if you miss any of the items here, you will
LOSE them FOREVER. Hence open your eyes wide! Proceed to the Training
Hall. You will find a girl and the man in the center of the hall if
you have done the kidnapper's rescue side quest earlier. Talk to the
girl and you will be given the following prompt:

a) You have to hang in there
b) You want to come with us?

Pick the second option (the more people you have, the more the
merrier...) Talk to the girl's dad and you will be given the prompt:

a) Who are you again?
b) Will you get on the ship with us?

Pick the bottom option and he will join you aboard the ship too! Do
NOT forget the chest in the northwest area of the area and you will
get one of the game's best handgear - Hero's Shield!

Once you are done, proceed to the hallway that leads to your room.
You will find your good old room and the kitchen. Proceed to the
kitchen and talk to Funghi twice. You will be able to able to recruit
him by picking the top option.

Make your way to the Spire and make your way to the rooftop. There
will be another chest. Search it and you will get a Treasure Map along
with a Guardian Bracelet. This is the only time that you can get these
2 items. Hence do not miss it!

Make your way to the Audience Chamber where you find the doorway being
blocked by a chest. Search it and you will get a Silver Hammer, which
allows Adrienne to upgrade your weapons to level 14 and more armor
making combinations. This is also the only time you can get this item.
Hence, do not miss it!

Make your way out of the Hall of Knights and make your way to Razril.
At Razril, move close to your ship and there will be a cutscene between
old friends. Talk to the cat and choose the top option and you will be
able to recruit it. (Do not miss it!)

Once it is over, make your way back to Main Street. Talk to a man
dressed in brown and you will get a Window Set 9.

Just make sure that you have gotten the following items. Below is the
checklist...

  Razril's Treasure for Evening

  Item                Location
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Hero's Shield       Chest located at the Training Hall
  Treasure Map        Chest located at the rooftop
  Guardian Bracelet   Chest located at the rooftop
  Silver Hammer       Chest located at the Hall of Knights
  Window Set 9        Man dressed in brown in the main street

Exit and head back to your room at the Hall of Knights and choose to
sleep (top option). Exit your room and you will find out all the chests
that you have seen in the evening are NO LONGER there. Make your way to
the rooftop and you will meet Ameria.

Make your way to the town. You will find Gretchen standing outside the
Armor shop. Talk to him and you will be able to recruit her! Now proceed
to the Equipment Shop and talk to Federica thrice and you will be able to
recruit her as well.

Exit the shop and head for back street area. You will meet Karl along the
way. Talk to him and you will be able to recruit him as well. Make your
way to your ship and you will meet an old friend who is coming for his
revenge...

(This naval battle will not occur if you have choosen to execute Snowe
 in your previous prompt)

 The answer for this battle is actually really simple. Have Ted as

 You have 3 ships to use use for this pointless naval battle.

 Likewise if you have execute Snowe before (i.e. the last option),
 this battle will not occur...

After naval battle is over and you will be given the prompt:

a) Just let him go...
b) Snowe, would you like to join us?
c) Off with his head!

Pick the top option or middle option to have Snowe exiled or the bottom
option to execute him. I choose the middle option. Once you are done,
you will find that the blue arrow is pointing at the Nest of the
Pirates, which is your next destination.

By the way, here is your newly found member stats:
 (Like Katarina, the 2 other Knights of Gaien will have same level that

Once you are out, there is more recruiting to do...

will find the Ancient Crab at the center of the forest. It is tough...

Secret Underground Path in Middleport
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:   Treasure Map, Ocean Rune Piece, Great Earth Armor, Sliding
         Door, Ivory Robe, Canvas 2, Old Book Volume 8
SOD:     Warlock (61) - Feather Hat, Magic Robe, Mother Earth Rune,
                        Flowing Rune
         Pecola (93) <Ornament Room>

Make your way to the Rune Cannon. Talk to Pablo and he will mentions
to you about a person named Warlock and you will be given a prompt:

a) Sorry tell me later
b) ...

Pick the bottom option and Pablo will give you a hint of choosing the
wrong way. Make your way to Middleport and bring in a strong party -
Pablo is not a compulsory character. I recommend to have all
characters around level 50 with the best armor equipped for them and
upgrade your attacker's attack to at least level 12.

Just bring in Ted and Hero along with 2 attackers (high HP). I have
Lino and Axel and given Lino the Earth Rune so that I could use Clay
Guardian when battling against the sub-boss.

Make your way to the back street or you may want to visit the Inn to
save your game first. Make your way to the Empty House and examine
the chest. You will be given a mathematical question:

51 - 24 = ?

a) 24 potch
b) 27 potch

Choose the top option as the wrong way hinted by Pablo and you will
end up in the Secret Underground Path area. You can find a Treasure
Map and Ocean Rune Piece in the chest. Move forward to the next area.

Secret Underground Path
-------------------------
This dungeon can be extremely difficult if you are bringing in a weak
party. Make sure your party is around level 40 and equipped with the
best armor. Bring in Ted if you want to have an easy life here. The
enemies have very high HP and they are tough to beat too.

 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 Enemies: Spectrel Leaves, Furball, Poison Bird, Ogre Frog 
 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The dungeon pathway is like a fork and below is the full map. Do not
use any level 4 spells and conserve them for the sub-boss in this
dungeon.

1st Area

                       A: Sliding Door

          \____/       Just get all the items found in this area
          |            and move across the wooden bridge to the next
          S            area. Remember to get the Great Earth Armor
                       from one of the chests.
2nd Area
-----------

 ____     A         A: Ivory Robe

      \ /   /       S: Start Point
  *    |   /
   \___|__/         This area is more linear than the previous one.
       |            Get the Ivory Robe and equipped it on Ted. Proceed
       S            to the next area.


3rd Area
-------------

A   |           A: Canvas 2
 \  |  /        X: Sub-Boss Fight!
  \/__/  
   |            Do not move over to X if you do not have any level 4
   \    X       spells left. You can find this battle for countless
    \__/        of times after you have completed this area and you
    |           can retreat from the battle.
    S

Move pass X and you will hear the boss's BGM... This battle has become
a compulsory battle, you can retreat or use potch.

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Land Dragon    HP: 6500                          Potch: 8000p

   The boss has ridiculously high HP and strong physical attacks.
   It has a wind-slash attack that does around 80-120 HP to one
   ally. An attack that could cause sleep on an ally while
   inflicting around 70+ HP damage. It has an area attack that
   does around 70-100 to all allies. It is rather similar to the
   Leviathan that you have encounter rarely on the sea except it
   is strong against Lightning.

   Start off by using Ted's LV4 Spell - Judgment. I managed to
   get to use it twice when Ted is at level 49 as it will wipe
   out 3/4 of the sub-boss's life and have other character's
   attack the remaining. The boss is very strong against
   Lightning but weak against Wind. Hence The Shredding works
   extremely well here.

   Items: Dragon's Scale
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Just move pass the area and you will reach the underground labortary.
Search the bookshelf on the left and you will get an Old Book Volume 8.
Talk to the old man (Warlock) twice and choose the top option as your
reply for both prompts. Talk to him and you will be able to recruit him!

   WPN LVL    1
   WPN PWR    5

Exit the Underground Path via walking or use the Blinking Hand Mirror (
your MP should be depleted by now) and rest at your room. Make your way
to 4th Deck Corridor, proceed to Deborah's Room. Talk to Deborah and
she will talk a lady who is interested in interior design. Exit and
choose Depart. Sail your ship and re-enter Middleport again.

Visit the Empty House at the back street and you will find Pecola who
will join you if you have the Interior Design Book, which can be
obtained from one of the ladies out the inn. You can access the
Underground Path via the stairway in the back area.

There is nothing else much to do except for heading for Nest of
Pirates.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Nests of Pirates
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:   Nothing!
SOD:     Tanya (37) <library>

Make your way there and you will meet Tanya who is standing at the
entrance. Talk to her and you will be given a prompt. Pick the top
option thrice and you will recruit her!

Make your way inside the cave and you will have a discussion chat
with Elenor, Lino and Kika. Hero will hand over the Golden Seal back
to Lino. Eventually, you will be given a prompt:

a) Of course.
b) Wh-What do you mean?

This is followed by some cutscenes and you will be back on the world
map. Make your way to Obel or you can visit Tanya and the library to
have the Old Book Volumes that you have uncovered for translation...

(S) Save your game

Make your way to the Kingdom of Obel.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Recapture The Kingdom of Obel!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:   Pirate King Bracers
SOD:     Flare (36) - Wind Rune
         Setsu (89)

There will be a cutscene and Lino is all dressed up (quite weird IMO).
Eventually, the scene will switch to the War Room and you will be
given a prompt on where the Gaien Ship will be assigned to the
Dauntless or The Grishend. This is followed by your ship setup.

Assign Hero's Ship with Wind, Fire and Lightning Rune while the other
2 ships with Lightning Rune & Wind Rune. Press Start to end your
setup and choose to the top option to commence the naval battle. I
choose to have the Gaien Ship to accompany the Grishend. Kika will be
fixed as the captain for Grishend. 

                   Naval Battle #9 - For Obel's Freedom
 ____________________________________________________________________
 2nd Kooluk's Fleet vs The Hero's Army (The Rush)
 
 Victory conditions:
 Annihilate the enemy fleet and take back the Kingdom of Obel!

 Opponents Stats
 -------------------
 Kooluk Ship A                   Kooluk Ship B

 Underlings:  200                Underlings:  150

 You will have a fleet of 3 usable fleets (the Dauntless, Grishend
 and the Gaien Ship). Make sure your fighters have decent armor and
 their weapons upgraded.

 At the beginning of the battle, you have only the Dauntless if you
 choose to have the Gaien Ship accompany The Grishend. At the second
 turn, you will find the 2 ships appear on the left flank where you
 can attack the enemy but they will counter since their cannons are
 facing these 2 ships. Counter Kooluk Ship B with Wind while Kooluk
 Ship A with Lightning and you will be fine.
 ____________________________________________________________________

Once the battle is over there will be some cutscenes and you have
captured Colton and his crew. There is a messager tell you that an
enemy fleet is coming and you will be given a prompt:

a) Let's go!
b) Please wait a minute

Choose the bottom option and talk to the crew next to Colton and you
will get the Pirate King Bracers. Talk to Elenor and pick the top
option to resume. It is another naval battle.

                   Naval Battle #10 - Mysterious Fleet
 ____________________________________________________________________
 Governor's Fleet vs The Hero's Army (The Rush)
 
 Victory conditions:
 Annihilate the enemy fleet!

 Underlings:  60                 Underlings:  50

 It seems pretty easy and it is a battle that you WON'T lose. Just
 give your ships Fire and Wind and you will be fine. Attack Kooluk
 Ship A with Fire while Kooluk Ship B with Wind and you will be fine.
 You can also approach them and choose board for an instant victory
 where you don't have to battle...

 In fact, you can choose to load any Runes that you like. Have a
 character with Rune power over 50 and the battle will be over in
 one hit!
 ____________________________________________________________________

This is followed by some cutscenes and Elenor will suggest to Hero to
use the Rune to fight out those ships.

a) My true Rune of Punishment
b) No I can't use the Rune...

If you choose the bottom option thrice, it will be an automatic
gameover like the one in Obel. Pick the top option and this is
followed by some bizarre events...

Move towards the Rune and you will meet an old friend...

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Glen's Shadow          HP:???
   Just attack the shadow...
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

You will be back awake in your own room. You will get your Level 4
spell - Everlasting Mercy for your Ruune of Punishment. Exit your
room and you will find out that Flare and Setsu has join your party!

If you go to the deck and witness the cutscene, you will not be able
to practice your naval tactics anymore. Elenor, Flare, Agnes and Lino
will not be found in their rooms.

Take out a party and bring in Yu and choose depart...

Remaining Stars of Destiny
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:  Golden Hammer, Guardian Sandals, Guardian Garb, Hero's Armor,
        Stone of Speed, Mermaid Bracelet, Treasure Map, Diamond x5,
        Prosperity Orb, Mixed Herbs, Silver Bracers
SOD:    Travis (16) - Feather Robe
        Snowe (17) - recruitable only if you have 107 SOD and choose
        not to execute him.
Potch:  42000p

Remember those pesky chests containing Angel Hairballs and they are
extremely tough to beat? It is time to seek revenge. Your party levels
should be around level 45 if you have been visiting the Middleport
Secret Underground Path for the time being. But there is a place
where you haven't visit it.

Obel Ruins
-------------
Have a party with an average level of 45 and bring them here. Bring in
Ted. Make your way back to the Ruins where you first meet Rikie and
Rakgi. You will encounter stronger enemies.

 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 Enemies: Skeleton, Armoured Wolf, Unicorn Zombie, Golem
 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Make your way across the winding path and you will reach the first
area of gathering right? Talk the path heading north and you should
be in a T-junction. Take the path towards left and their is another
winding road. Make your way and you will reach a split path with a
chest opened (you should have taken the One-Piece Dress...). Choose
to take the path in the north. There is a chest in the empty area.
Open it and you will face...

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Angel Hairball    HP: 3000                     Potch: 10000p
   There are only 4 Angel Hairball fights along with 2 Golden
   Hairballs fight. They are very strong in magic but weak in
   magical defense. They have the ability to use Breath of Ice
   which does around 110HP damage to all allies even they have
   around 90 MDF stats. I just used 2 Judgment and the battle
   is already over...

   Items: Nothing!
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

After the battle is over, you will get the Golden Hammer. This hammer
is very good as it allows you to make the game's best armor via
material combining and upgrade your weapons to level 16!

Make your way back to the empty chest and choose the path next to it.
You will reach another "gathering area" but with a save point.

(S) Save your game

Take the path that is closest to the Save Point and move north. Once you
reached the Inner Ruins, you will find a huge golem at the spot where
you find a save point. Do not make contact with it or you have fight it
and you cannot beat if your party has fully-recovered (hint: that Golem
has a five-digit HP...)

To avoid the fight, just move around it and make your way to the backyard
where you find the tree. There is a man called Travis found near the
tree. Talk to him and he ask you whether you have an Escape Talisman...

Use the Escape Talisman (not joking) and you will be at the entrance.
Make your way back to the inn in Obel and choose to stay to recover
your lost HP (120p). Return to the ruins and you will need to move to
ALL THE WAY BACK where you find Travis...

1) L-Walkway
2) Gathering Area - Take the north path
3) T-Junction - Take the left path
4) L-Walkway
5) Split Path - Take the path next to the chest
6) L-Walkway
7) Gathering Area - Take the north path that is next to the Save Point
8) Split Path - Take the north path
9) Inner Ruins - move past the Golem by moving around it.

Finally, you have end in the tree where you meet Travis. Talk to him
and you will be able to recruit him!

Return back to your ship and use the Blinking Mirror. Now do a headcount
or have a view at the roster. There should be only 1 empty spot if you
have been using this walkthrough...

Mordo Island... A man on the plank
------------------------------------
 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 Enemies: Killer Rodent, Yellow Rodent, Rodent Leader, Red Rodent,
          Blue Rodent, Paradise Bee
 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The mountain pathway is actually a treasure hunting. Once you enter
that area, the BGM and the character will change. You will be able to
hunt for treasure if you have the relevant treasure maps.

Make your way to the hot spring and talk to the merchant. He will say
that he spotted someone on a wooden plank in the ocean. This will only
happened if you did do the following: Have Snowe exiled and did not
execute him on your previous 2 attempts.

Set sail west off Mordo Island and there will be a cutscene. A man is
found on the plank and you will be given the choice:

a) He can't be forgiven. Off with his head!
b) Perhaps we should let him join us...

Choose the bottom option and congrats! You have all 108 Stars of
Destiny. Snowe will resume from his previous level that he left your
party earlier. Hence it will take a while to train him, just like the
other 2 Knights of Gaien. But it is definitely worthwhile as he and
Hero is able to use the game's strongest Combo attack.

Middleport
--------------
 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 Underground Path
 Enemies: Spectrel Leaves, Furball, Poison Bird, Ogre Frog 
 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Make your way back to the Empty House in the backstreet. Talk to the
Youth and he will award you with the Guardian Sandals!

Nest of Pirates
-----------------
Make your way to the Nest of Pirates. Talk to the one of the pirates
inside the pub and you will get a Mermaid Bracelet!

Iluya
---------
 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 Enemies: Stun Lizard (destroyed town), Bloody Behemoth (destroyed
          town), Kooluk Soldier (advanced base), Kooluk Archer
          (advance base), Kooluk Captain (advanced base)
 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Make your way to Iluya and it is time to finish off the remaining 2
Angel Hairballs. Make some preparations and bring a party whose level
is around 45 and have weapons above level 12 with best available
armour equipped. Bring in Ted, Hero and another magician (preferably
Maxine or Jeane) and a support character (I use Snowe because I have
level him up considerably..). Battle 10 battles with Hero and Snowe
to learn the True Friendship Attack. Upgrade both character's weapons
to at least level 14.

Make your way to Kooluk Advanced Base area. Search the chest near the
well and you will fight another Angel Hairball.

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Angel Hairball    HP: 3000                     Potch: 10000p
   This is the second fight of the trio. Use a combination magic
   with Jeane or use the True Frienship attack with Snowe. The
   battle will be over soon. Be careful of enemy's strong magic
   attacks. Conserve Ted's Judgment for the other battle.

   Items: Nothing!
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Once the battle is over, you get the Guardian Garb. Give to Ted.
Restore everyone's HP back to max. Make your way down to the Destroyed
Town where you meet Nataly. There is another chest in the area and you
will fight...

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Angel Hairball    HP: 3000                     Potch: 10000p
   This is the 3rd Angel Hairball fight. Unleash Ted's LV4
   Soul Eater spell - Judgment and it will be over in 2 turns
   if Ted is at a high level...

   Items: Stone of Speed
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

After the battle is over, you will get the Hero's Armor. 

Deserted Island
-----------------
 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 Enemies: Moss Behemoth, Golden Wing, Queen Sprout (forest only),
          Savage Frog, Dry Fly
 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
As stated earlier, the enemies have become stronger once you have
liberated Razril from Kooluk rule. The enemies here are tougher & you
will be having a tough time if you do not have Snowe (around level 40,
best armour, True Frienship Attack learnt, Fury and Double-Strike Orb
Runes). Most of the enemies have around have 1000+ HP. Queen Sprout
and Savage Frog has around 2000 to 3000 HP each. But the good part is
that these enemies drop rare items such as Silk and a lot of potch.
The Subterranean Lake has an instant healing point as usual. There is
a giant crab (Ancient Crab) that is stationed at the forest. You can
choose to fight it but don't go for it unless your party is well-
prepared (please refer to Section 9 for more details)

Limeshelf Island
------------------
 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 Enemies: Mosquito
 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
The island is located at south off Razril in the southern ocean or
directly west off the Nest of Pirates. Bring in Kika or some characters
who can deal an area attack or Slash orb if your party level is around
45. You will find a series of stone path. Make your way up the stone
path (expect some twisting and turning) and you will reach the dead end.
There is a chest containing a Treasure Chest there! Once you have
discovered this island, you will be able to teleport here and do your
treasure hunting if you have the Treasure Maps with Rene.

Mountain Mass Island
 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 Enemies: Evil Bat (lower area), Fish Fiend (upper area)
 ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
The island is located at the northwest corner of World Map. You will
find a pointy island there and it is directly north off Razril. Once
you reach the island, you will be able to re-access it via the Blinking
Mirror. Likewise, the island is full of treasures...

Make your way to the upper area via the curving path on the left. Once
in the upper path, you will find 4 spliting paths. There is a chest on
the westmost pathway that contains 10000p. Make your way up to the
intersection point. Take the left path and there is another chest, open
it and you will fight...

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Golden Hairball           HP: 400                Potch: 2000p

   It is typically no challenge if you choose to fight it with
   your level 40+ characters. You will be able to wreck it with
   a single attack or a spell...

   Items: Nothing!
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Once the battle is over, you will recover the contents of the treasure
chest and you will get Diamond x5 and Prosperity Orb. Return to the
intersection point and take the path in the middle. It will lead to a
chest containing a Mixed Herbs. The path on the extreme right leads to
a chest containing a Silver Bracers.

There is nothing much to do than doing some treasure hunting, playing
mini-games, collect all Old Book Volumes, upgrading weapons etc.

(S) Save your game

If you are interested, you choose to battle the 2 optional bosses in
the game. Please refer to the Side Quests and Mini-Games for details.
If you visit the Deserted Island, the enemies encountered there has
also changed and there is a giant crab at the forest (which is one of
the game's optional bosses)

                             Preparations
 _____________________________________________________________________
 Fighters
 -----------
 Fighters Group #1 - Jewel, Paula, Keneth and Tal for the Gaien Ship
 Fighters Group #2 - Sigurd, Hervey, Dario, Gau for Grishend
 Fighters Group #3 - Ugetsu, Shiramine, Flare & Lino for the Obel Ship
 Fighters Group #4 - Snowe, Axel, Selma, Izak for the Dauntless

 - Make sure sure everyone is around level 45 with at least Platinum
   Armor equipment (for figthers) and Tai Chi Garb for Archers who
   are fighting in naval battles as fighter.
 - Their weapons must be sharpen to at least level 12.

 Rune Cannons
 --------------
 Have 8 Rune users - Ted, Maxine, Warlock, Pablo, Konrad, Katarina,
 Jeane and Viki. Give Konrad a Water Rune. Give Wind Runes for Viki
 and Pablo. Train the Rune users to at least level 50. See the
 training tips below for details.

 Set the Rune users in this manner:
 Dauntless - Ted (Water)/Maxine (Wind)
 Grishend - Viki (Wind)/Warlock (Water)
 Gaien Ship - Katarina (Lightning)/Konrad (Water)
 Obel Ship - Jeane (Lightning)/Pablo (Wind)

 Detachement Party
 -----------------------------
 - You cannot use their equipment for New Game+. Hence do not give
   them any rare accessories. But make their equipment is strong
   enough as the boss for their party is strong
 - I opted for 2 attackers and 2 healers strategy. Mizuki seems to
   be excellent choice as her Shrike Rune can deal heavy damage on
   her. Bring Mizuki will bring in Akaghi (but I give him the Earth
   Rune and Water as he is a support member). The other 2 members
   must have access to level 4 spells. For my case, I choose Federica
   and Kate, they is able to gain level 4 spells at level 51)
 
 Main Party Preparations
 -----------------------------
 - Sharpen Hero, Ted, Snowe and Kika's weapon to level 16
 - Give them the best armour you have.
 - Have Hero and Kika learn Double Sword Attack and learn True
   Friendship Attack with Snowe. Equip a Fury Rune for Snowe. Train
   up you have level up these attacks to level 3
 - Give Kika a Wind or Earth Rune.

 Training Tips
 -----------------------------
 - The two optional boss can be fought countless but I don't recommend
   you to fight them unless you are bring a party level whose average
   is around level 60 (Refer to Section 9 for details)
 - Obel Ruins and the Deserted Island are having new enemies.

   Between level 20 to level 40 - Na-Nal
   Between level 40 to level 44 - Middleport/Deserted Island
   Between level 45 to level 50 - Obel Ruins

   Train Snowe, Hero, Kika and Ted as your primary objective. Just
   keep on training till you are able to upgrade both Hero and Kika's
   weapon to level 16. Once you got that, Kika and Hero's Double Sword
   Attack can deal 350 to 400 HP damage to all enemies if they are at
   level 50+ and weapons at level 16. Once you got Kika, train Snowe
   and Ted, your detachement party, lastly the 16 remaining attackers 
   and 8 Rune members to level 50 miniumum and give the attackers
   decent armor.
 _____________________________________________________________________

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Infiltrate Into Kooluk! (Point of No-Return)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Items:    Wooden Amulet

Make your way to the Deck and there will be a cutscene with Mizuki and
Akaghi. If you are observant, you won't find Elenor, Agnes, Flare and
Lino in their rooms. This is because they are in the War Room. Make
your way there and you will get a cutscene and Elenor will tell you
that it is time to go head on against Kooluk and you need to take care
of the Rune Cannon on board on Fort El-Eal. You need to sent a
detachment party. Remember once you choose to do the mission, you will
not be able to return back to other towns of the world.

Choose the top option and you will be given 3 days (or 3 minutes ^_^).
Talk to Elenor and you will be able to assign the detachment party.

                         Seperate Task Force
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   I choose Mizuki and Akaghi as you need to rescue Ramada (sounds
   logical right?) Federica is also a good choice as she has a feud
   with Cray. As for the last member, I choose Kate so that you can
   have a useful group attack when visiting the final dungeon. Give
   one of the members have a Water Rune so that you could heal.
   Have a Lightning Rune to each member if they is able to use level
   4 spells. Give Akaghi the Earth Rune. Do not give these party any
   rare Runes as these Runes cannot be used for New Game+
   ------------------------------------------------------------------

Elenor choose to accompany the detachment party and you will be given
a prompt:

a) I am counting on you, Ms. Elenor.
b) You shouldn't. It's too dangerous.

Exit the war room and head back your room and rest. Exit your room
and make your way back to the War room. You will be given three options:

a) I will prepare a little more
b) Reorganize a seprate team.
c) Yes. I am ready!*

(Once you choose Option 3, you can no longer return back to the world
 map)

Pick the last option once you are confirmed to be ready and there will
be a gathering in the war room...

"Victory will be ours!"

It will be night time and there will be a cutscenes.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------
 Additional Notes
 - You cannot access elsewhere on the world map during this point
   of time.
 - Once you are out of Lino's room, you cannot access it anymore
   because the latter has locked his room!
 - Do not talk to Reinhold as you are going to fight the training
   matches on your own.
 - You can shop, play games or take a bath if you like
 - You cannot rest in the inn or save your game anywhere except
   at the save orb in your room
 - You cannot access the war room
 - Some of the characters are missing and I can't seem to locate
   Flare...
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
You will be at the deck. The knights from the Hall of Knights have a
chat. Talk to Kika and there will be a cutscene. Make your way to the
front of the ship and there is another cutscene with Sigurd and Hervey.

Make your way to the Saloon. Talk to either Rita, Noah or Rene and you
will get a Wooden Amulet accessory. There are some more scenes if you
visit Lino's Room or Elenor's Room. Pay Ted and Katarina a visit and
there will be some more scenes. After you have talked to Rikie and
Rakgi in their room, there will be a cutscene. Talk to Federica at the
library. Make your way to the fifth floor and there will be a *big*
surprise cutscene...

Make your way to the Rune Control room and you will find that poor
Pablo is *extremely* busy. By the way, you can upgrade your ship if you
talk to Tov. For more details, please refer to Section 9.

Make your way back to your room and there will be a scene with a close
friend. Make your way to bed and there will be a cutscene with Leknaat
if you have recruited all 108 stars of destiny...

Items:   Mega Medicine, Hero's Helmet, Cape of Darkness, Chaos Shield,
         Goddess Robe, Mixed Herbs x2, Mega Medicine, Fortune Orb,
         Magic Canceller

Once you are awaken, check the Save Point and you are anchored at near
Fort El-Eal. Make some preparations and remove for all except the
particpating members (except the 16 characters for fighters, Runes for
the Rune cannons users, your main party and the detachment party)

Make your way to the deck. There will be some more cutscenes. Hero will
talk with Lino

a) Well... umm...
b) It's hard to say...

You will be controlling Elenor (with the detachment party). Make your
way up the pathway and there will be a view of the Fort. The screen will
switch to the Dauntless and some more scenes. Eventually, it is a naval
battle...

                   Naval Battle #11 - Final Engagement

 It is a tough naval battle. The chances of you losing ships are high
 as the enemies' Rune cannon at a high level and you need to have
 more underlings. Set up 1 Wind Rune cannon each for the ships on
 left (i.e. the Grishend and Daunltess) and 2 Lightning Rune Cannon
 for ships on the right. For secondary, have Water Rune for all ships.
 I choose Water because it is the only Rune element that does not
 have a weakness against Troy.

 Have the Grishend take care of the Kooluk Ship B while Gaien Ship
 and Obel Ship take care of Kooluk Ship C. Due to the high underling
 stats, Kooluk Ship will move last among all Kooluk ships. Destroy
 the 2 enemy ships with Rune cannons and combine all the ship to
 attack Troy. Once you get the chance to board the ship. Choose to do
 it. Hope that you did so as boarding is the key to win the battle.
 Board in such as a way that the ship's head or tail is facing you
 (the enemy will unable to counter) and the enemies are really weak.

 This is a more effective way to win a naval battle like this. That's
 is why I have told to make serious preparations for all boarding
 members. Below is the summary of my ship setups:

 The Grishend       Dauntless       Gaien Ship     Obel Ship
 C: Kika            C: Hero         C: Brec        C: Jango

 R: Wind            R: Wind         R: Lightning   R: Lightning
 R: Water           R: Water        R: Water       R: Water

 1) Hervey          1) Axel         1) Tal         1) Lino En Kludes
 2) Sigurd          2) Izak         2) Jewel       2) Ugetsu
 3) Dario           3) Selma        3) Keneth      3) Shiramine
 4) Gau             4) Snowe        4) Paula       4) Flare

 Notice something about my setup? I have choosen in a way that you
 can use combos. Combos will deal more damage and they are more
 effective that attacking on alone unless the character is well
 equipped. Make sure Tal, Jewel, Keneth and Paula learnt the Knight
 Attack as the one of the best all-attack combo after Hero and Kika's
 Double Sword Attack. All attacker's weapon should be at least level
 12 and equipped a minimum platinum-type equipment.

 If a ship is destroyed, the characters on board the ship will not
 proclaim as dead. However, if they got killed in a battle, they WILL
 be proclaim as dead and you cannot use for future battles.
  ____________________________________________________________________

Once the naval battle is over, you will be controlling Elenor and the
detachment party. 

   =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Note (Do not equip*)
   Please note that do not equipped any rare Runes (such as Mother
   Earth, Rage or Fortune on these characters) or any accessories on
   these characters if you intend to keep some for a New Game+ game.
   =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Make your way up the pathway and there will be a chest. Grab a Mega
Medicine from it.

  ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
  Enemies: Elite Captain, Kooluk Soldier, Elite Soldier, Elite
           Trooper (stairs), Royal Guard Archer (stairs), Kooluk
           Captain, Kooluk Archer, Grain of Light (stairs)
  ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Once inside the fort, you will encounter Kooluk soldiers ranging from
captains, archers to elite soldiers. They are a bit stronger than the
ones you have encounter in Iluya or Na-Nal harbour but they are still
managed if your party level is around level 52 or so. Conserve your
magic and avoid using level 3 and level 4 spells against these enemies.
You need them for a boss battle.

Make your way inside the fort. Take the stairs on the right and you
will be heading to the basement.

Basement
---------
Make your way towards north and along the pathway there is a chest,
search it for Hero's Helmet. (Do not equip it*). Make your way up the
dead end where there is a cell with a dead man. Search the dead man
and you will get the Cape of Darkness (do not equip it*)

2nd Floor
-----------
Make your way back to the first floor and used the left staircases.
On the left is a room that leads to "Stairs" which is locked for the
time being. Behind that block is an Angel Hairball which I suggest
you to deal it with your main party. Make your way up the stairs and
you will reach a similar area.

3rd Floor
-----------
Make your way to the back of the area and the the path will leads to
the meeting room where those Kooluk government holds their meetings
there. The path opposite the door leads to a chest containing a
Goddess Robe. Make your way back to the stairs and move your way up

4th Floor
-----------
The path will leads to the Rune Control Room. Do not enter it. Search
the chest on the right of the door for another Mega Medicine, Mixed
Herbs and Fortune Orb. Heal your party and restore MP if necessary.
Enter the room and there will be some scenes. Eventually, it is a
boss fight:

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Graham Cray       HP: 4500                       Potch: 1000p
   Start off the battle by combining level 4 spells to unleash
   a strong spell. I start of the battle by unleashing all my
   strongest magic. Do this because Cray will set up a shield
   that reduces all damage by half (which also includes magic)
   which will only for 5 turns. Cray has 2 basic attacks, a
   hand beam attack that does 80+ HP damage to all allies and
   a single target hand beam that does around 100+ HP damage to
   all allies. Keep everyone's HP above 150 and you will be
   find. Have Akaghi cast Earth Rune's Clay Guardian so to
   reduce the damage dealt by Cray. Once he got the shield on,
   use Combos or Mizuki's Shrike Rune and avoid wasting your
   magic. Keep up the endurance and you will beat Cray in no
   time.

   Items: Nothing!
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Once the battle is over, there will be some more scenes and you will be
controlling Hero who is at the front of the Fort. At this point of
time, you can return back to the ship to remove the equipment along with
Runes for all the 16 fighters by talking to Rakgi who is at the end of
pathway (where Elenor starts off). To get back to the fort, talk to
Rakgi. You can only have 3 other members. It may seems a bit redundant
but it will be good if you intend to bring some of these armor for your
New Game+...

Once you are done with your preparations, talk to Agnes and you will
be able to setup your party:

Main Party
-------------------
Ted is a must-have if you want to have an easy fight for the final
boss fight. I choose Ted over other magicians because he is faster and
a decent attacker as well. As my other members, I choose Kika and
Snowe. Kika is mainly for fighting Kooluk royal guards so that you can
conserve magic when combined with Hero, provided their weapons are
sharpen to the max. Snowe and Hero can wreck heavy damage when their
True Friendship Attack especially if you sharpen them to level 16 for
both characters.

Once you are done, enter the fort. Make your way to 2nd floor and
search for a chest behind the block with a door that leads to "Stairs".
Open the chest and you will fight...

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Angel Hairball    HP: 3000                      Potch: 10000p
   Do not drag the battle for too long or it could use Water
   Dragon Rune attack! Just have Hero or Snowe used True
   Friendship for 2 times (provided if you have really upgrade
   both of their weapons to level 16), Kika using Falcon and
   Ted attack normally. If you want, unleash some magic...

   Items: Nothing!
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Once the battle is over, you will get the Chao's Shield. Make your way
to the Rune Control and you will be able to access a door which leads
to the office. Search the blinking object on the table for a Stair Room
Key. Wonder why I choose to fight the Angel Hairball with the main party
and not the detachment party? Here is the reasons. Examine the sofa and
you will rest for free like your bed at the Dauntless!

Make your way back to the 2nd floor and head for the locked door. You
will be able to open it. In this area, you will encounter even
stronger Kooluk Soldiers with an average of 600 HP each. Conserve Ted's
spells especially Soul Eaters. Instead, make use of Kika and Hero's
strong party attack

From the door, you will find a chest under the stairs. Search it to get
the Magic Canceller. Make your way the spiral stairs till you reach the
next screen (i.e. past the yellow). Make your way UP again until you
reach the next marker (Build up your Rush meter and do not use it. Save
it for the boss fight, you will need it) In the 3rd screen, there will
be some point of time, you will find a chest containing a Mixed Herb.
Lastly once you reach the door. There is a Save Point. Heal your
character's health back to full. Make your way to the room and there will
be some scenes and prompts. Eventually, you will have your final boss
fight!

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Giant Tree        HP: 12500                      Potch: 3000p
   Seeds of Light    HP: 3000 each

   The boss could change colours and its elemental. Before is the
   elemental chart:

   Colour      Element        Weakness/Notes
   Red         Fire           Water (Breath of Ice)
   Orange      Wind           Fire (Final Explosion)
   Blue        Water          Lightning (Soaring Bolt)
   Green       Earth          Wind (The Shredding)
   Yellow      Lightning      Earth (Earthquake)
   White       N/A            Danger!

   The boss will change colours from turn to turn and it will also
   unleash seeds that also carries elements. The Wind Seed could
   cast spells especially the annoying Wind of Sleep. Kill of any
   seeds that bares an orange glowing light. The boss has a normal
   attack that does around 120 HP damage to an ally, the seed's
   glow attack that does 80 to 100 HP damage to all allies. Once it
   is white, it will unleash a devasting beam attack that does
   around 240 to all allies (even with Clay Guardian on). Hence
   conserve level 3 spells for Ted (i.e. Kindness Rain) and use
   Hero's Everlasting Mercy as your last resort.

   The boss will be able to regenerate countless Seeds of Lights
   (which can cast attacking spells on its own). Hence, focus on
   the main boss. Use a group attack i.e. Kika/Hero Double Sword
   Attack or Ted's Soul Eater. When the boss' HP is halved, it
   turn white, use your Rush attack to prevent it from using its
   devastating attack. Rush actually skips it turn. Just keep on
   attack with Hero and Snowe's Friendship attack and you will
   be lower the boss' HP. Once it is about to be killed, it will
   turn white again. Use Hero's Everlasting Mercy, unleash Ted's
   Judgment, Kika using Falcon and you should be winning the
   battle sooner or later...

   Items: Nothing!
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Once the battle is over, the fort starts to tumble and you will need to
make your way out of the fortess. Once you are out of the fortess, make
your way down the stairs. Before you talk to Rakgi, remove all the
equipment from your current party except for Hero (unfortunately, you
cannot recover any of the Runes, that is the reason I recommend you to
have Kika in the party and sharpen her weapon to level 16). You will be
back on your ship and you will be prompted to meet Troy to a one-on-
one duel.

  below, you can guess what to use against him ^_^)

  Quote                                                 Choice

  I will settle this with the next move                 - Guard
  Prepare yourself!                                     - Guard

  -----------------------------------------------------------------

Once the battle is over, there will be some more scenes and you will
be forced to use the Rune and eventually comes the Rune screen again...
Remove all equipment from Hero before moving to the glowing object.

Enjoy the ending. After the credit roll (it takes around 5 to 7
minutes), you will be prompted for a clear game save. Choose to save
your game and you will be able to access New Game+ with your cleared
Save data via Continue option from the Saved Menu.

4.0   Runes Bestiary
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Runes are the source of magic in Suikoden IV. To use Runes, you need to
get "Orbs" and have a Rune Master to equip it on a character for a fee.
Removing Runes also requires a fee. You can equip a maximum of 3 Runes
per character - Head, Left Hand and Right Hand.

There are character's unique Runes, which can on be equipped on a
certain character and you cannot remove them. Basically Runes can be
divided into 2 types - Magic and Skill Runes.

=======================================================================
4.1 Magic Runes
=======================================================================
There are 5 basic Rune elements - Fire, Wind, Earth, Water & Lightning
in Suikoden. These Runes elements have opposing effect on others. For
example, Fire is strong against Wind but weak against Water. Hence,
learn on how to exploit to maximize the character's battle
effectiveness. Equipping magic Runes also helps to give a character a
Rune bonus for Rune Cannons in your naval battles. For example, if you
equip a Fire Orb on Chiepoo, Chiepoo is able to use Fire as his Rune
cannon! For the effectiveness of the element, please refer to the Rune
Affinity Chart.

Character Specific Magic Runes
---------------------------------
There are 3 such Runes - Blinking, Rune of Punishment and the Soul
Eater. Below are the Rune stats and some useful notes that you want to
take note of. These Runes deals non-elemental damage to its target(s)
and cannot be disarmed from these characters.

Rune of Punishment
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rune governing atonement & forgiveness.
User: Hero

Spells
-----------
LV1  Eternal Ordeal           -300HP to 1 enemy, -30HP to self
LV2  Double-Edged Sword       -150HP to all enemies, -50HP to self
LV3  Voice of Death           Very fatal (1 enemy), 10% fatal (self)
LV4  Everlasting Mercy        -500HP (all enemies), +500HP (allies)

Finding it:
-------------
- You will get it once you got exiled from Razril

  LV2 spell - After you have defeated Giant Crab at Deserted Island
  LV3 spell - After you have used in Obel to save Lino.
  LV4 spell - After you have used in Obel seas to save your party from
              mysterious fleet.

- As it states the Rune consumes the user's life, make sure you have
  someone to support Hero by maintaining his HP. Ethernal Ordeal is
  extremely useful early in the game and Double-Edged Sword is useful
  for clearing enemies that are in group. The tougher the enemies are
  hit, the higher damage Hero will receive. The most I seen is Hero
  receiving only -70 HP. Voice of Death does not work on bosses and it
  could also kill Hero by chance. Everlasting Mercy, the Rune's final
  spell is a good 2-way spell (heals and attacks) but unfortunately it
  comes a bit too late but yet a good spell when party is critical low
  on HP.

Soul Eater
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rune governing life and death.
User: Ted

Spells
-----------
LV1  Finger of Death          Drains 1 enemy's life energy
LV2  Black Shadow             -300HP to all enemies
LV3  Hades                    Drains life energy of all enemies
LV4  Judgment                 -1500HP to one enemy

Finding it:
-------------
- You will get it once you have recruited Ted (i.e. complete the Fog
  Ship Quests).
- This is the game's best Rune as it contains the best non-elemental
  attack spells. Black Shadow is extremely useful for training
  characters as it instantly deals ~450 HP if Ted is at level 48.
  Judgment is a deadly single enemy spell... Hades and Finger of Death
  can drain around 100+ HP from enemy to Ted. Plus, Ted has a Water
  Rune to boot and thus making best all-round support character.

Blinking
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enables teleportation magic
User: Viki

Spells
-----------
LV1  Ready!                   Teleport 1 foe. Backfires if it fails
LV2  Set!                     -200HP to all enemies
LV3  Go!                      Teleports all enemies

Finding it:
-------------
- You will get it once you have recruited Viki.
- Ready! will teleports one enemy out of the battle but sometimes it
  removes Viki or even your other party members. Hence take note of it.
  But the Blinking spell will have a higher hit rate if Viki has higher
  Luck stats. The most useful spell is perhaps Set!, which does -200
  non-elemental damage to all enemies.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Magic Combos
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Like Combo, Magic can combo if both characters has a usable level 4
spell left. Only the 5 basic elemental magic spells allow you to create
a combo:

Name of Spell       Runes       Damage
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sorched Earth       Fire        -1500HP to all enemies
                    Earth

Where to get it?
- You can find it inside a chest at Elenor's residence at Hermitage
  Island

Attributes Boosting Items
_______________________________________________________________________
Attribute Boosting items will add a stat bonus permanently on a
character. I.e. if you use a Stone of Strength on Hero, his strength
will raise by 1 without the aid of using equipment or accessories.

Stone of Strength             Increases strength level.
Stone of Defense              Increases physical def. level
Stone of Skill                Increases skill level.
Stone of Evasion              Increases evasion level.
Stone of Magic                Increases magic level.
Stone of Magic Def            Increases magic def. level
Stone of Speed                Increases speed level

Getting these items are hard as enemy do not drop them most of the
items. You can only get them from random battles by having a character
with Support - Found Treasure and it is only 1 out of 20 chances that
the enemies may drop them. BTW, attribute boosting items will sell for
zero potch.

========================================================================
5.2   Sealed Orbs
========================================================================
Sealed Orbs contains Runes, the magical power in Suikoden. However in
order to use sealed power of the Rune, you need to have a Rune Master
to equip on your character. Rune Masters can be found in Rune Shop and
they also sell orbs. You can buy them and have them equipped. They will
also charge a fee (between 100p to 300p, only Jeane and her assistant
at your ship offers the fee of 100p) which is applied when equipping an
orb or removing one. Hence to cut costs, it is wise to recruit Jeane
fast...

Most of the orbs can bought from Rune Shops. In fact, Jeane's Rune shop
will sell all the Runes that you have bought from Rune shops in the
towns.

7.0   Combos Bestiary
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Combo is a special attack that allows two, three, and even four
characters to execute a combined attack for more damage, attack all
targets and some of them even heal the party.

Not all characters can learn Combo or they started off with a usable
combo except for Hero and Snowe's Friendship Attack at the beginning
of the game.

To use a combo, both character requires to have that the turn free.
For example to execute Double Sword Attack for both Kika and Hero,
Hero and Kika must not be doing anything else. If Hero cast a spell,
the combo will be unusable as Hero has already use his turn.

Combos can gain levels and their attacking power/effect will gain
levels. They will also be more effective when you have stronger
weapons.

To learn a 2-person combo, it takes around 5 to 10 battles depending
on the character's affinity. To learn 3-person combo, it takes around
8 to 12 battles. To learn a 4-person combo (only Keneth, Tal, Jewel
and Paula) could learn, it will take around 12 battles to learn it.

Barrage Attack Notes
------------------------
Barrage Attack has 4 forms and it is a requirement that you will be
need to learn Barrage Attack (1) and (2) first in order to learn (3)
or (4). Think of a diagram like the one below:

                 ___ Flare ____________
                /      |               \
            Ted ____ Aldo __________ Lo Hak
              \       |                /
               \___ Frederica ________/

In order for Ted, Frederica and Lo Hak to learn Barrage Attack, you
need learn Ted/Aldo/Frederica and Ted/Aldo/Lo Hak or Ted/Flare/Lo Hak.

4 Combo
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Name of Attack            Characters      Damage
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Knight Attack             Tal             250 Water damage to all
                          Jewel           enemies
                          Paula
                          Keneth

Combos can be improved in 2 ways, by fight with the characters involved
for more battles or upgrade their weapons by sharpening. Combos can
also gain levels and they will gain levels after you have fought:

Level 2     ~20 battles
Level 3     ~30 battles

In other words, it will take around 50 battles to level up combo
attacks to level 3. You can also improve the damage by equipping a Fury
Orb or Double-Strike Orb (better effect if both are equipped) so they
can deal more damage with the combo.

Some combos can missed even they are at level 3 like Gau and Dario's
Berserker Attack. When it stated as 1.0x damage it doesn't mean exactly
1.0 of the two/three characters attack power combo. It could be more
or less depending the enemy's defense or luck (critcials). Combos like
Ugetsu and Shiramine's Fisherman Attack (very useful as it never miss)
or Hero and Kika's Double Sword Attack are very useful in weakening a
group enemies when training.

Hence, do not hestiate to try out all combos!

naval battles tactics, mini-games, treasure map hunting, cultivation
room, shipwright options, etc.

9.1   Advanced Naval Battles Tutorial
=======================================================================
Naval battles can be easy if you come prepared or hard if you are
confused elementals strengths and weakness.

Ship Stats
---------------
You will have a total of 4 vessels (sounds more professional than
ships) to use at the end of the game. You will be able to use the
following four ships and their stats:

                 Move       Hull      Range    Obtained
             _________________________________________________________
Dauntless        4          12        3        When you flee from Obel
The Grishend     3          7         3        When you meet Kika
Gaien Ship       4          7         3        Liberate Razril
Obel Ship        4          7         3        Liberate Obel

To upgrade the ship's defense and range, you need to use Ocean Rune
Pieces which are scattered in various treasure chests around the
world. There are a total of 5 Ocean Rune Piece per game and you can
use them on your ship by talking to Tov, who is located in the
Shipwright's Room, 4th Deck Corridor. For details, please refer to
Section 9.7.

Captains
---------------
Throughout the course of the game, you will be able to have 11
selectable captains. Captains will have an impact on the ship's
mobility, hull defense and attacking range. They will also usually
carry more underlings than other characters.

Rune Cannons
---------------
For support characters, the element of the Runes are fixed and you
can change it. For playable characters (i.e. characters that you can
used them for battles), you can use Runes and the effect will be
different due to different affirnity to Runes.

Red        Fire           Strong against Wind, Weak against Water
Yellow*    Wind           Strong against Earth, Weak against Fire
Green      Earth          Strong against Lightning, Weak against Wind
Purple*    Lightning      Strong against Water, Weak against Earth
Blue       Water          Strong against Fire, Weak against Lightning

* I supposed the creators have made an error in the colour coding.
  Lightning supposed to be yellow and wind should be purple as
  according to the crystals.

Rune Affinity Chart
------------------------
These character can have five different elements depending on the Runes
that you have equipped on the character. The list may take me a few
updates to complete this listing. Initially, I thought that the power
of Rune Cannon depends on the character's level but it is wrong when I
saw a level 1 Tal having Earth Rune of attacking power 20!

Underlings
--------------
Different characters have different levels of underlings. Underlings
actually represents the health meter of the ship. The more underlings,
the most Rune cannon shots that a ship could last. However having more
underlings will affect the ship's mobility and hence may be the last
to move if you have too many underlings.

Pirate Ship A    4      3      5         Fire, Wind, Lightning, Water
Pirate Ship B    4,     3      5         Fire, Wind, Earth, Lightning
Pirate Ship C    4      3      5         Wind, Earth, Water, Lightning

How to deal with these ships? My strategy is very simple. Do not use
Runes that weak against them. Fire your Runes in such a way that the
opposition cannot counter and bring your fighters and defeat the ships
by boarding. You cannot use the Flashes command if your fighter is
being equipped with the Slash Orb. The only usable commands for
fighters in naval battle are Attack and Combos.

9.2   Trading Posts and Money Earning
=======================================================================
The objective of trading post is simple - earning potch by buying low
and selling high. Certain items are sold in various trading post while
some aren't. For example, Soap is sold in Nay-Kobold Settlement along
with Obel only.

Below are the listing of all trading posts:

Trading Post                  Location
----------------------        ----------------------------------------
A) Mordo Island               Located on the beach, wooden planks area
B) Na-Nal Island              Located at the harbour
C) Nay-Kobold Settlement      Located at the lower area of the town
D) Middleport                 Located at the harbour
E) Obel Kingdom               Located at the lower area of the town

----------------------
Combining Materials
----------------------
These items can be used for making accessories (mermaid shop), cloth
armour (Phil) and armor (Adrienne). You will get better ores or cloth
as you buy-and-sell bad quality ores/cloth at ANOTHER trading post.

                     Bad         Normal          Good
   Requirments:      N/A         40~50 "Bad"     20~30 "Normal"
                                 Traded          Traded

All Trading Posts starts of with the bad version of the materials. To
get a "Normal" version of the cloth/ores, you need to buy around 40+
of the ore/cloth and sell it to another trading post in order for
Normal ores to appear at that trading post where you sell the ores.

9.3   Treasure Hunting
=======================================================================
Treasure Hunting is probably toughest mini-game in this game. You can
start playing this mini-game once you got Rene in your party which is
after you have fled from Obel.

---------------       ----------------------------------
Island                Location
---------------       ----------------------------------
Donut                 East of Obel*
Mordo                 Northwest of Obel
Limeshelf             South off Razril
Mountain Mass         North off Razril

* To located Donut Island, you must locate the empty bottle on the
  beach of Nay Island. Otherwise, you cannot locate the island or
  recruit Rene.

General Hunting Tips
------------------------
There are a total of 30 treasure maps in the game. 27 of them can be
found in the course of your journey, 1 of them can be found on one of
these islands and the remaining 2 maps can be found by playing the mini
games.

Once you reach the island, you will find the background music has
changed and in place of Hero, you will be using Rene instead. She will
be carrying 2 dowsing rods and here are the controls:

L1 + Left/Right:          Switch maps on the map indicator
Triangle:                 Hold down to walk
X:                        Dig for treasure
D-Pad/Left Analog Stick:  Move Rene around the terrain
R2:                       Changes map view
R1:                       Holds down to run

Basically, you just need to move to the spot marked on the current map.
Rene will only analyse for you the map graphics but there is no
indication on which island has the treasure except for the first one.

Once you are on the map, move around slowly do not run and pay
attention to the beeping sound lead by the dowsing rods. Once a beep
signal is deteched the dowsing rods will be pointing at the spot where
the treasure it. Move Rene towards it *slowly* and until it vibrates.
Now hold Triangle button and move around until the dowsing rods are
pointing towards each other or across each other and the beeping sound
stops. Once it stop, it means that you are on the spot that is marked
on the map. Once you have achieved that, hit X and you will be prompted
where you want to dig. If successful, you will get the treasure!

Switch your radar to the largest one and compare it to the map. Then
you will have a clear view of where the arrow is pointing. Some maps
are distinctive while some will show only the textures (especially for
Mordo Island and Mountain Mass Island).

=======================================================================
9.4   Net Fishing and Pole Fishing
=======================================================================
This can be done only after you have fled from Obel, recruited the 2
fishermen - Ugetsu and Shiramine. They can be found in the rear deck,
which is accessible from the door next to the blinking mirror or
opposite the war room. This is provided that they are not in your
current party.

Pole Fishing
---------------
Although it is nothing new to the Suikoden series, pole fishing is
still one of the most addictive mini-games. You need to pay 100 potch
in order to fish. Talk to Ugetsu and pick the top option "Yes! Let's
fish!". You will be given a prompt whether you want to hear Ugetsu's
explaination. Pick the top option to skip it and you will be given 3
options:

1) Okay
2) Sorry, I'll pass.
3) I want to see the record

        A             B          The screen will look something like
   -Hero --------------  |       the diagram on the right. Fishing will
                         |       only ends if you have the fish moving
                        |-|      from point B to point A. This is can
                        |-|      be done when the gauge is in between
                         |       the slider and it is green. If it is
                         |       light blue for too long, the fish
                         |       will escape with your bait! If line
                         |       stood at red for too long, it will
                         |       snap.

The objective is tap X to maintain the line gauge at green and keep on
maintining the the line reached A. You can caught up to 6 kind of
fishes: Sardine, Red Snapper, Mackerel, Puffer Fish, Bonito & Crab. The
fishes you caught could be used for cooking by talking to Kevin or Pam.

Sardine            Boiled Sardine
                   - Recover HP.
Mackerel           Mackerel Miso Stew
                   - Recover HP.
Puffer Fish        Puffer Fish Sashimi
                   - Gain HP. Magic attack up for 3 turns
Bonito             Minced Bonito
                   - Gain HP. Attack strength up for 3 turns
Red Snapper        Whole Roast Snapper
                   - Recover a lot of HP
Crab               Boiled Crab Stew
                   - Gain HP. Magic defense up 3 turns.

Net Fishing
---------------
To start Net Fishing, just talk to Shiramine and choose to cast a net.
Choose Depart and move around the ocean for some time (around 6 to 12+
minutes). Anchor your ship and revisit Shiramine, ask him to pull up
the net and you will be able to get to view the items that you have
gotten. Simple right?

Talk to Shiramine and you will be given the following options:
1) Let's cast the net
2) Let's pull up the net
3) Explain net fishing to me

The objective is to cast the net and wait for some time before you
choose to pull up the net. You will stay get items even if you did not
move the ship at all. But you must access the world map (i.e. hit the
sea). You haul up treasures (such as ornaments that can be used for
the ornament room), an ocean Rune piece, Snowe's garments (obtainable
after you have recruited him) and more fish.

Apparently, net fishing works depends on how much time you have spent
on the ocean. The longer you spent, the larger the haul of treasure
will be. In fact, you can draw up treasures by just simply anchoring
your ship at the harbour (i.e. using Blinking Mirror to access a town
and talking to Rikie). It normally takes around 6 to 12 minutes to get
a good haul. Likewise, you can still haul a large amount of fish by
just waiting in the ocean. Give your party a lot of luck boosting -
3 Lucky Rings for each character including Hero and bring in characters
with good luck - Chiepoo, Reinbach, Rita, Pablo etc. To have more luck,
place Lucky Rings on your Ship Party A and B. This also explains why
people have difficulty in getting Snowe's additional garments.

To get Lucky Rings, you can purchase from them from your equipment shop
for 20000p each. But money should not be a problem if you have Noah
and Prosperity Runes equiped and fighting at the Deserted Island...

=======================================================================
9.5   Optional Bosses Battles
=======================================================================
There are 2 optional bosses in Suikoden IV. The first one is the
Ancient Crab, which can be found in forested area (where you defeat the
crab that is after Chiepoo) on the Deserted Island after you have
liberated Razril from Kooluk rule and the Killer Golem, which appears
at the ruins of Obel after you will be able to visit it for the second
time, in other words, liberated Obel from Kooluk rule.

The bosses are *hard* and you need have a party of around level 55 to
defeat them. My recommended party is:

Hero     - Upgrade his weapon to level 16, Rage Rune
Snowe    - Upgrade his weapon to level 16, Double-Strike & Fury Runes
Kika     - Upgrade her weapon to level 16, give her the Earth Rune
Ted      - Upgrade his weapon to level 16, Prosperity Rune as his 3rd
           Rune

Combo Attacks learnt: Double Sword Attack, True Friendship Attack

Double-Strike Orb: Buy it from your Rune Shop
Fury Orb: You will get one by completing the Training Hall session

Speed Rings are extremely useful accessories as they boost speed by
10 each. Give 3 of them to Ted and Hero. They can be bought from your
equipment shop for 20000p each. If you want, have another 2 Speed Rings
and a power ring for Snowe and another 3 Speed Rings for Kika.

True Friendship Attack will deal 1.5 damage of the combined attack power
of Hero and Snowe but with the Double-Strike and Fury Runes, it becomes
3.5! (1.5 + 1 + 1). Therefore, it should deal around 2900+ to one
enemy! (This is the damage rating of Ted's Judgment!)

After you have eliminate all the Kooluk threat from the southern
islands, you should have the complete set of Pirate King Set armour
if you have followed the walkthrough. Give it to Hero. Give Hero's
Armor and Hero's Shield to Snowe and try to boost up Snowe's defence
as he will be receiving twice damage as compared to others due to the
Double-Strike Orb. Give Kika and Ted some good armour and boost
everyone's defense to around 200.

---------------
Ancient Crab
---------------
Visit the Deserted Island after you have liberated Razril from Kooluk
and you will find tougher enemies here. But you will be able to finish
off the groups of enemies (more than 3 enemies) with the Double-Sword
Attack and a Dark Shadow. If you encounter Savage Frog or Moss Behemoth
use True Frienship attack and Kika's Falcon Rune. To earn BIG money in
a few turns, equip the Prosperity Rune for Ted as his third Rune.

As mentioned earlier, the Ancient Crab can be found in the open area
in the forests of the Deserted Island. It is a big object that you
can't miss. Make contact with it and it will be a boss fight.

   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   Ancient Crab      HP: 11000                     Potch: 25000p

   The boss has a lot of HP (it take you *ten* True Frienship
   Attacks if you did not equip the Double-Strike and Fury Orbs)
   The boss has 2 flamethrower-type attacks - one is a single
   target flamethrower that does around 160 to 200HP on one ally
   & the other one is a flame thrower group attack that does
   around 120 to 140 HP on all allies. Just start off by having
   Kika casting the Clay Guardian (in my opinion, this is one
   of game's best support spell that has been overlooked by most
   gamers). Have Hero and Snowe used True Friendship Attack and
   Ted using Judgment, you should deal 5000+ HP already. Next
   the boss will attack. Depend on the move, if it use a single
   attack, have Ted heal that character with a Kindness Drop. If
   it does a group attack, have Ted heal with Kindness Rain. Have
   Kika join in the attack by using her Falcon. In around 3 turns
   or so, the boss should be dead minced crab meat (^_^)

   You can use "Flashes" for an instant kill once Hero is at
   level 60 with Slash Orb equipped.

   Items: Giant Crab's Shell, Diamond
   =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

After the battle is over, the crab will no longer be there. However if
you revisit it (i.e. use Blinking Mirror or exit via ship), you will
find the crab there! The boss offers you one of the best sources of
money and items.

---------------
Killer Golem
---------------
The Killer Golem is a tougher enemy as compared to the Ancient Crab
except that you need to battle a lot of enemies (I would normally
encounter 6 to 7 random battles before I get to face it). Just have
Hero and Kika use Double Sword Attack + Ted's Dark Shadow and the
random battles will be breeze work in the park. Make your way to the
inner ruins. Or if you want, here is the steps to get there:

1) L-Walkway
2) Gathering Area - Take the north path
3) T-Junction - Take the left path
4) L-Walkway
5) Split Path - Take the path next to the chest
6) L-Walkway
7) Gathering Area - Take the north path that is next to the Save Point
8) Split Path - Take the north path
9) Inner Ruins - you will find the Golem there.

Make contact with it and you will face a boss fight.

  =-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
  Killer Golem      HP: 13000                     Potch: 30000p

  The Killer Golem has more HP compared to the Ancient Crab &
  it is much tougher. It has a mega punch attack that does
  around 200 to 350 (if you did not equip a good set of armour)
  and a mega beam attack that does around 180 to 200 to all
  allies. When it's HP is low, it use a heal spell that restores
  around 1100 HP to itself.

  Start of the battle by having Kika using Clay Guardian (boost
  your defenses), Ted attack using Judgment, Hero and Snowe use
  True Friendship Attack. Once it attack you, heal the member(s)
  that is hit with Ted. Have Kika attack with her Falcon Rune.
  Keep up the endurance and the battle will be as simple as the
  one you have for Ancient Crab except you need to another turn

  You can use "Flashes" for an instant kill once Hero is at
  level 70 with Slash Orb equipped.

  Items: Diamond or Platinum

9.6     Mini-Games
=======================================================================
Mini-games usually adds extra enjoyment to your game and you can get
rare items by just playing them. To play mini-games, you can play a
game by just talking to the owner and they must not be in your current
party. Gunter, Noah, Rita, Basil and Igor offers the mini-games and
they can be found at the Saloon (2nd Deck Corridor) once you have
recruited them.

Generally, only Dice and Ritapon will only earn you more potch as they
are a variations of gambling while Basil's Tops, Igor's Coin Toss,
Noah's Cards and Mice Catching at Nay-Kobold nabs you prizes.

Basil's Tops
______________________________________________________________________
Owner:   Basil

Previous Encounters: 
- Razril (Town Square, outside the Inn)

Fee:     100p per game

Overview
-----------
While the top is spinning on the table. It is considered to be "alive"
If it topples over or falls off the table, the top is considered to be
"dead". You will be allowed 3 tops per game. The first one to run out
of live tops on the table loses. That's all there is to it! Brown tops
on the left hand side belongs to the player while the the tops on the
right belongs to Basil.

Playing instructions
-----------------------
- Toss the top using the X button.

- Once the first one is thrown, you have to get ready to toss another
  one right away. That is because you never know when the top you
  just toss might "die".

- Lose the match when even when all 3 tops are on the table and in
  "die" status.

- Pick target location with D-Pad or left analog stick. Once ready,
  press X to toss your top. A gauge will appear on the left hand side
  with a moving arrow. Stop the arrow with X button. The closer the
  arrow to the red zone in the middle, the better the toss accuracy
  and topspin will be.

- After toss the first top, you have to wrap a string onto the top -
  doing these by rotating the left analog stick or pressing the
  directional buttons in a rotating motion. The tops might die if
  you take your own sweet time, so don't let your guard down! You
  can toss the top by pressing X button even if you haven't entirely
  wrap the string around it. Less the top being wrapped, the weaker
  the spin will be.

- Toss an unwrapped top, it will topple over the instant it is
  tossed!

  Prizes             Normal Items           1st Time Accomplishment
  --------
  1 win:             Medicine               Medicine
  5 straight wins:   Cough Drop             Window Set 3
  10 straight wins:  Escape Tailsman        Old Book Volume 2
  15 straight wins:  Jizo Clock             Simple Sofa
  20 straight wins:  Mixed Herbs            Treasure Map

Special prizes will be awarded for the first time you reach each set
number of wins. Once a winning streak is broken, you will get nothing!
Once you have gotten the streak, choose to end the game in order to get
your prize. If you end it with a loss, you will not get the item!

Tips & Strategies
-------------------
- Get prepared to have some sore fingers after the end of these top
  spinning matches.
- Do not hit X unless you are released a top.
- Twirl left analog stick as fast you can, in clockwise motion and
  try to release the top within the yellow range.
- Try to release a top, around 2 to 3 seconds after your opponent

Dice
_______________________________________________________________________
Owner:   Gunter

Previous Encounters: 
- Middleport (outside path leading to Back Street)
- Na-Nal (Hillside Town, after you have completed negotiations with
  Na-Nal chief, i.e. Axel has joined you)
- Obel (Town Square, near Equipment Shop after you liberated Obel from
  Kooluk rule)

* In order to recruit Gunter, you must play against him at all 3
  meetings.

Fee:       MIN. 80p for Down to One (20p per wager)
           MIN. 100p for Triple Toss

Overview
------------
The dice throwing mini-game is relatively simple and it is quite
addictive in my opinion. The cursor will moves around the bowl and you
need to hit X when it reaches a desired position. The rest is up to
luck. If you hit at the edge of the bowl, most of times you will get
a "dead" dice which is an instant loss.

Down To One
-----------
This is a game where each player takes turns to roll the dice. Whoever
rolls a 1 first wins. If anything else comes up, you have to put in the
same number of Potch as your roll. Whoever wins gets all the Potch in
the pot. If it ends in a draw, each person splits up the potch in the
pot. If a dice leaps out of the bowl, it's considered "dead" and you
will lose. You'll have to look carefully at the marks and roll so that
it'll land properly in the bowl.

Triple Toss
-------------
This is a game where each player takes turns to roll the dice. Of the
three dice you roll, if two come up with the same number, the remaining
die will become your score. Whoever has the higher score wins. If there
is no score after 3 tries, youi will have a "no roll". There are special
situations and they are:

4-5-6        Double wager
Any triples  Triple
1-1-1        Quintuple (5x)
1-2-3        Pay double your wager

Any dice rolls out leap out of the bowl, it is considered a dead roll
and you will lose.

Notes:
I believe there is a "cheating lock" that prevents gamer from abusing
this dice game to earn big cash. The probability of you earn when you
using big bets is *extremely* low.

Ritapon
_______________________________________________________________________
Owner:   Rita

Previous Encounters: 
- Na-Nal Inn (once you established your stronghold at Obel)

Bet Range:   500p - 1000p - 5000p

Overview
-----------
Rita-pon is actually a variation of Mahjong except it is being played
between Hero and Rita. The objective is to collect 3 sets with a 3-of-a
kind or 1-2-3 combo. There are a total of 41 tiles:

Red      1   2   3       Blue      1   2   3
         1   2   3                 1   2   3     Fire
         1   2   3                 1   2   3     Wind
                                                 Earth
Green    1   2   3       Yellow    1   2   3     Lightning
         1   2   3                 1   2   3     Water
         1   2   3                 1   2   3

The 41 tiles comprises of the following 9 reds tiles, 9 blue tiles, 9
green tiles, 9 yellow tiles and 5 elemental tiles. 

                             Examples:

3-of-a-kind                                1-2-3
-------------                              ----------
Red 1, Red 1, Red 1                        Red 1, Red 2, Red 3
Yellow 1, Yellow 1, Yellow 1               Green 1, Green 2, Green 3
Fire, Wind, Lightning                      Blue 1, Blue 2, Blue 3
Earth, Water, Fire                         Yellow 1, Yello2 2, Yellow 3


Playing Instructions
------------------------
- Use the D-Pad or left analog stick to move your cursor and you can
  select a tile with X. For any 5 of elemental tiles, you will be able
  to use the tile with the circle button:

  Fire        Destroys opponent's tile (no. of tiles destroyed varies)
  Water       Allows the user to choose a tile that has been discarded
  Earth       Protects the user's tiles from any elemental effects
  Lightning   Allows the user to pick 3 tiles in succession
  Wind        Allows the user to hide opposition tiles and thus allow
              the user to view the tiles!

- You can have a maximum of 9 tiles on hand. To pick a tile, you need
  to discard one from your lot. The first player to get all tiles of
  3 sets of 3-of-a-kind or 1-2-3 will win the match. You can play up
  to ten rounds and quit at any point of time. Each player will start
  of 10000 points. The first player whose points is fully depleted will
  lose the game and there will be no more rounds. The winner will also
  be awarded the Hakoten bonus!

- Terminology

  - Pon
  The player could choose to do this when the opposition discard a tile
  and he/she has 2 of same tile in his/her own set. E.g. if Rita
  discards a Red 3, you can call "Pon" if you have 2 Red 3 in your
  hands.

  - Reach -> Ron or Tsumo
  When you are just short of a tile to win the round, the moment you
  discard the unwanted tile, you will be in "Reach" position. I.e. the
  discarded the tile will be placed in horizontal position instead of
  the normal vertical position. Reach position will be broken if the
  opposition uses the Fire tile.

  You can win the game by "Tsumo" or "Ron". Tsumo happens when you pick
  the tile from the lot directly i.e. you pick your own tile. Ron
  happens when Rita discards a tile, which is just the tile that you need
  to win.

  - Raiyuko
  This will happens when nobody is able to win the round. It is another
  word for "Draw"

  - Hakoten
  If you drain all of Rita's points, i.e. her points have been drained
  to zero, you will get a Hakoten bonus and you will get the number of
  rounds x the amount that you have wagered. In other words, you win 5
  rounds and drain all of Rita's points and wager 500p per round, you
  will get a Hakoten bonus of 500 x 5 = 2500p! If you lose to Rita and
  got drain off all your points, you will need to pay her the Hakoten
  bonus too!


Tips & Strategies
------------------

I don't quite understand how this game is being played intially but
start to get a hang of it as I played more rounds. It is really an
addictive mini-game and it is a good way to earn money before you could
recruit Ted.

If you got the Lightning tile, make sure you use as it allows you to have
more options in setting up your tiles. Use Earth tile only when you are
about to win the game. Wind tile is not really useful for you but it can
be very annoying as it hides your tiles and it makes you to discard to
the wrong tiles. Hence, it is a good practice to remember the tiles that
at the start of the game.

Your view:
Red - Green - Blue - Yellow - Elemental

Rita's view:
Elemental - Yellow - Blue - Green - Red

From the Wind tile, you can roughly gauged what kind of combination that
Rita is going for. Hence gauge and avoid discard the tile that she wants.
It is better to settle for a draw than losing right? Use the Fire only
when you need to discard it or Rita is about to hit the reach position.
Fire tile can be useful but it could also destroy the tile that you want
too. Lastly, you will be more familiar, if you play this mini-game more.
On the first time, you got Hakoten, you will be awarded with a Mushroom
as well.

Cards
________________________________________________________________________
Owner:     Noah

Location:
- Antechamber (Obel)

Betting Range:    500p - 2000p - 5000p

Overview
-----------
The objective of this card game is to place the cards that the total
value adds up to 51. You will be awarded points for every card that
you put on the table. The player whoever has the most points when the
game ends (i.e. total value of cards add to 51 or more) wins.

Playing Instructions
------------------------
- At the start of the game, you will draw a card to determine who will
  go first. The player who drawn a card where the number is larger
  than the opposition will go first.

- Each player will take turns to place out a card on the table. You
  will be able to view the opponent's cards and yours. Pay attention
  to the sum of the all cards put down by both players while they
  are discarding. Once the total of all cards adds to 51, the game
  ends. Whoever has more points in the end wins. Each player can hold
  a maximum of 5 cards at one time.

- There are a total of 40 cards - 5 Fire, 5 Wind, 5 Water, 5 Lightning
  and 5 Earth.

- When you are betting at a higher wager rate, you will be hit with
  a timer if you take too long to place a card. If you did not place
  a card, you will forfeit your turn!

- Multiple of Tens
  If you put a card whose sum happens to be a multiple of 10 (i.e. 10,
  20, 30, 40, 50), you get 10 bonus points. If the cards on table has
  7 and you put down 3, you will get 3 + 10 bonus points.

- 51
  If you put down a card that makes the pile of cards equal to 51
  exactly, get 20 bonus points! If pile exceeds 51, 10x the amount
  over 51 will be subtracted from whoever discarded last.

- Combos
  You can play a "Combo" if the cards have the same Rune. If the card
  on the table has the same Rune as your card, you can play them in a
  row. You can just stack on the same Rune cards until you do not
  have any the rune cards left. If you get a bonus during a combo,
  you get a huge bonus of 10x the amount of your combo!

Tips & Strategies
-------------------
- If you get to start, go for a card that is as small as possible and
  best if Noah does not have that elemental card
- Go for multiple of tens and place a card of an element that Noah does
  not have and make sure that the card number total does not add to 10.
- Try to familiarise the game with low wager rates as it will remove
  that annoying timer.

Mice Catching
_______________________________________________________________________
Owner:     Nay-Kobold outside Warehouse of Nay-Kobold Settlement

Location
------------
- Nay-Kobold Settlement (playable after you have recruited Nalkul and
  Champo)

Overview
---------------
You will be control Champo in a mice-filled environment. The objective
is relatively simple. You need to catch mice and put them into the cage
within 99 seconds.

Playing Instructions
---------------------
- To catch a mice, you just need to hit X button when the mice is
  directly below Champo. Once you caught a mice, you need to place in
  a cage. Just position Champo facing the cage and hit X to dump the
  mice into the cage. You will lose the mice if you got knocked into
  the walls or even if the cage if you go too fast. Very often, mice
  tend to escape when you throw them off the cage

- Mice works in groups. They will save the caught ones by attacking the
  cage. Make sure you did not let the cage's durability meter drop to
  zero or else all the mice that you have caught will escape! A smart
  move is to wait for the mice to gather near the cage and caught them
  in one swoop but it will tends to waste a lot of time.

- You can run by holding down R1 button. But running aggressively will
  cause Champo to bang into walls and it will take a couple of seconds
  for Champo to recover and thus wasting precious seconds.

- You can also sneak on your prey by holding the R2 button. Sneak works
  well when you are directly behind the mouse and it is not moving a
  lot. Sneak takes up a lot of time but it is good when you are
  catching the last mouse.

- You will be awarded a special prize when you succeed the first time

Prizes
----------
The table shows the prizes that you can win when you complete the mice
catching game on your first attempt. The subsequent attempts will nab
you the normal prize instead. The numbers below the size type indicates
the number of mice that you need to catch in order to complete the
mission.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tips & Strategies
- Like Noah's card game, try out the Average sizes first and try Shiny
  and Slippery.
- Avoid banging into walls or the cage.
- Once you caught a mouse, aim properly before attempting to place it
  inside the cage. Otherwise, you may end up to catch it again, thus
  wasting precious time of the timer.
- Avoid holding R1 when playing in Slippery conditions when you are
  rushing back to the cage.
- Make use of the right analog stick to move the camera so that you
  can have a better view.
- If there is mouse or mice attacking the cage, use "Sneak" (hold down
  R2 and X when Champo's hand surrounds the mouse's body) to catch it.
- If the mice is attacking from inside, just make your way back to the
  cage and it will "scare" them from doing it. Avoid staying too far
  away from the cage unless you are chasing after the last mouse.
- You did not need to catch and place the last mouse inside the cage.
  Catching it will allow you to complete the mission!

9.7     Shipwright
=======================================================================
To access the Shipwright options, you need to visit Tov, who is the
Shipwright Rooms that is located next to the Training Hall. In the
room, talk to Tov and you will hand over all the Canvas that you have
found to him and you will be able to use the Ocean Rune Pieces to
upgrade your ships.

Talk to Tov and you will be given this prompt:
a) I want to modify the ship
b) Oh, nothing

Change Design
----------------

Canvas 1        "White and Maroon"
- You start the game with it.

Canvas 2        "Yellow and Maroon"
- It can be found in a chest located in the Secret Underground Path
  accessible via Middleport's empty house.

Canvas 3        "White and Black"
- You can obtain this via treasure hunting.

Customize
--------------------
The Ocean Rune pieces are rare rune pieces that can be found through
the course of your game and you can use them to upgrade your ships. You
can upgrade the Dauntless (or any name that you have given to it), The
Grishend, Gaien Ship and Obel Ship.

First of all, select the ship that you want to upgrade. You will be
able select an Ocean Rune Piece and you will add 1 point per Ocean
Rune Piece. You can distribute these points only for the select ship.

Shooting Distance       Change shooting distance (use 5 points)
Mobility                Change mobility
Armouring               Change Armoring
Remaining points        <the number of points you have left>

For example to upgrade Shooting Distance to next level, you need to use
5 points (i.e. assign 5 Ocean Rune Pieces). As for getting Ocean Rune
Pieces are rare, hence you should use them wisely

That is all the possible sets!

=======================================================================
9.10    Training Hall
=======================================================================
To get the training hall started, you need to have recruited at least
29 characters. The training hall offers the best way to gain levels as
your training opponents are based on Hero's level. In other words, the
higher level Hero is, the more experience points they will offer.

Despite having your friends as foes, they will be able to use Runes
even they are not equipped with it. As the battles get going, they will
be casting higher level spells and heal more often with Healing Wind or
Kindess Drops.

You will be fighting 4 enemies (comprises your crew characters) per
battle up to the maximum of 5 battles with the last battle having
Reinhold as a compulsory member. Knowing who could be a strong
magician helps a lot in fighting training battles as they could deal
tremendous damage on a group effect.

You can start training battle once you have recruited Ted with both
Hero and Ted at level 53.  Ted should be able to cast 4 Level 3 Spell
(i.e. with the Mother Earth Rune, he could cast 4 Earthquakes)
Have the following setup

Hero     Rage - Rune of Punishment - Water
Ted      Soul Eater - Mother Earth - Water

Have Carrie, Gary or Ema as your support character

To get the Rage Rune, disarm from Konrad and equip on Hero. To get the
Mother Earth Rune, disarm from Warlock and equip on Ted.

Upgrade Hero's weapons to level 16 and get him the Pirate King armour
set. Give Ted the Guardian Set (you should be left with the hat but I
replaced with the Hat of Wisdom). Equip 3 Speed Rings each for Ted and
Hero. Give your other 2 characters a magic rune.

Now talk to Reinhold and choose to fight in the training battle.

1st Battle: Hero cast LV 2 Burning Wall, Ted cast LV 2 Soul Eater
2nd Battle: Hero cast LV 2 Burning Wall, Ted cast LV 3 Earthquake
3rd Battle: Hero cast LV 3 Explosion, Ted cast LV 3 Earthquake
4th Battle: Hero cast LV 3 Explosion, Ted cast LV 3 Earthquake
5th Battle: Hero cast LV 4 Final Flame, Ted cast LVL 3 Earthquake

(Have your other member casts any magic spell as this will normally
 causes the turn to be set according to SPD and MAG, hence Hero should
 cast first followed by Ted on most occasions)

With the battles, 85% of the time you should be able to finish the
battle without losing much health. Whenever you finished a battle,
Reinhold will challenge you another one, which makes the battles in
a continous flow. Once it reaches the fifth battle, Reinhold will joins
in and he will be able to cast Explosion or Soaring Bolt which is an
instant death attack. Hence finish him off fast. This also applies to
sorcerers, archers (especially Lo Hak, I seem to be cursed in fighting
him). If you die in the training battle, you will still retained the
EXP you have gained but loses the items or MP that you have used in the
training battle. As you get higher levels, bring in someone who is able
to use level 4 spell (preferred a Lightning) so that character can
combine with Hero to use Flame Array and target on Reinhold in the final
level.

When you completed the training mode on the first time, you will get
the Fury Orb (an excellent orb when equipped with Double-Strike Orb).
For the subsequent completions, you will get a Slash Orb (ideal for
item hunting when your party level is high or skipping boring random
battles). The Slash Orb could be sold for 2500p if you want to use it
for making some cash.

The training mode offers the *legal* way to get your character's to
level 99. Hence, good luck to you!

=======================================================================
9.11    Nataly's Window Sets
=======================================================================
Once you have recruited Nataly, you can change the "windows" or on-
screen designs with the Window Sets that you have found. These items
are tough to obtain as some of them can only be obtained via net-
fishing or playing throw the mini-games.

Window Set 0
 - This is the default window settings, you start the game with it.

Window Set 1
 - You can obtained it via net-fishing around the Obel region

Window Set 2
 - You can find it in a treasure chest found in Obel Ruins. Please
   refer to the walkthrough for more details.

Window Set 3
 - You can obtain it as prize for playing Basil's tops mini-game by
   earning 5 wins in a row.

Window Set 4
 - You can obtain it from the chest located behind the Trading Post
   at Mordo Island's harbour.

Window Set 5
 - You can obtain it via treasure island hunting (Map 5)

Window Set 6
 - You can obtain it via net-fishing around Razril region

Window Set 7
 - Complete the mice-catching mission with "Extra Large" and "Normal"
   at Nay-Kobold Settlement warehouse (after you have recrutied Champo
   and Nalkul)

Window Set 8
 - You can obtained it via net-fishing around the Obel region

Window Set 9
 - You can obtained from a man in the alleyway at Main Street of Razril
   town after you have liberated Razril from Kooluk rule. Please refer
   to the walkthrough for more details.

If you hand over all the Window Sets to Nataly, you cannot bring it
over for your New Game+. However, you will have your window settings.

=======================================================================
9.12    Cultivation Room
=======================================================================
To get rare items such as Mint, Mushroom or Mixed Herbs, you can get it
from winning card games against Noah (which is extremely rare) or
simply by cultivation.

Talk to Mao if you want to grow Mushroom
Talk to Nao if you want to grow Mint

Preference Settings
_______________________________________________________________________
For every stage, you will be given to set the following preferences in
this order:

  Humidity -> Temperature -> Lightings -> Ventiliation - Fertilizer

Humidity            Temperature              Lightings
---------           ---------------          ------------
1- Damp             1- Really, really cold   1- Pitch-black
2- A little dry     2- Slightly warm         2- Maybe a little bit
3- Dry              3- Stuff & Humid         3- Blindingly bright!

Ventiliation                        Fertilizer
--------------                      -------------
1- None                             1- Yes let's use plenty
2- Maybe a little bit of air        2- Just a bit will do
3- Open these windows wide!         3- We don't need fertilizer

Growth Stage
______________________________________________________________________
The growing mushroom/mint process consists of 5 stages.

1) Growth Stage          "Right now the spawns are growing"

2) Development Stage     "Right now the mushrooms are in their
                         development stage"

3) Pre-Harvest Stage      "Soon it will be time to harvest the
                          mushroom"

<Harvest Time>            "We will be able to harvest them soon"

4) Sleep Stage           "It is time to seperate the plants and let
                          them sleep"

<Special battle>          It will appears on the 2nd time of each
                          successful mushroom that you have won.

Between the stages, you need to go to your bed to rest or visit the
training hall, visit other places. For example, after you have set
your preferences for stage 1, exit and the cultivation room. Use the
blinking mirror and made your way to the town. Anchor and choose to
rest in your bed. Return back to the cultivation room and you will be
able to proceed with stage 2 by talking to Mao twice. Their first
sentence will normally be "Wait just a little longer, okay?"
Sometimes, you may need to rest a lot of times in order to get to the
next stage...

So when do we know it is time for harvest?

After you have received the prompt, "We will be able to harvest them
soon", there will be a blinking pointer in the package that is in the
middle of the room. Examine and you will get your product:

Mushroom        Growth Stage          - 1,1,3,1,3
                Development Stage     - 1,1,3,1,3
                Pre-Harvest Stage     - 1,1,3,1,3
                Sleep Stage           - 1,1,1,1,1 -> Special Battle

The numbers next to the stage are actually the prompts.

For example,
                     1,1,3,1,3 means...

 Humidity        - Damp
 Temperature     - Really, really cold
 Lightings       - Blindingly bright!
 Ventiliation    - None
