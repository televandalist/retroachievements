6.  My Really Important Items List

6a.  Introduction

The various items below are what I consider the best in the game.  For lists
that are comprehensive, I recommend you check suikosource.com and Ryvius' FAQ
here on gamefaqs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6b.  Runes

-Balance.  Protects wearer from unbalanced status.  Random item for Mt. Path
 treasure boss in ch. 4.  Very rare.

-Champion.  Enemies that can be "Let Go" will no longer approach.  Rare
 encounters and treasure bosses will still appear.  Usually found as item for
 Cyndar Ruins treasure boss in ch. 5.

-Cyclone.  Higher level Wind rune.  Climb ladder at Chisha Appraiser shop; a
 woman there will give it to you in ch. 4 (if Chris is main character, will
 have to wait until ch. 5 to get it).  Random treasure on Kuput Forest corpse
 closer to Chisha side.  Bazba comes with it (can't be removed).

-Double Strike.  Damage given and received is multiplied by 2.  Random treasure
 item for Mt. Hei-Tou boss in ch. 2, a common item at the Le Buque Rune Shop in
 ch. 5.

-Firefly.  Wearer is the first choice of an enemy attack.  Very useful for
 Tank characters.  Drop item of Purple Creepers in North Cavern during Thomas'
 chapters.  Rody comes with it (removable).
